The question is asking about a property of something (color), but it's not asking for a description of the thing itself, so it's not a DESC category either. The question is indirectly asking about a property of an acid, but the main focus is the color, not the acid itself. Therefore, the closest category would be DESC, but since the categories are predefined and DESC is not an option, I would suggest creating a new category for this type of question, such as PROP (property).
