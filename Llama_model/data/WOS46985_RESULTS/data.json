Methodologies are described in detail for: (i) PBR and microalgae mat surface preparation, (ii) contact angles (CA) and zeta potential (ZP) measurements for both microalgal cells and PBR surfaces, and (iii) microscopic methods for studying the evolution of adhesion intensity. The impact that these methodologies may have on the photosynthetic apparatus of the cells, the biomass concentration and cell viability are also quantified. A lab-scale flat-plate PBR was used to performa long-term batch culture of the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana, in which a devised rack of 25 PBR glass surfaces were submerged. To study the cell-to-cell and cell-to-PBR surface interactions, the existing surface thermodynamics and colloidal theories (XDLVO) were used. The major outcomes were: (1) that N. gaditana has a exposure time threshold to the electric field produced by the ZP meter; (2) a linear equation is provided for predicting the PBR surface potential as a function of the culture medium's ionic strength; (3) the biofouling growth curve on the PBR surface varied in line with the growth kinetic followed by the freely suspended culture cells; (4) the devised PBR slide rack system offers a versatile experimental platform for generating biofouling results, making it suitable for the in situ efficiency evaluation of antibiofouling coatings; (5) there was a significant variation in the surface free energy of the PBR surfaces and algal mats with respect to that present at the beginning of the culture, and, consequently, the application of thermodynamic theories failed to predict cell adhesion over long-term cultivation. However, the XDLVO model satisfactorily explained the dynamics of the adhesion studied. The reported results might be useful for research in the microalgal production and PBR engineering area.

Measuring this distance has been a key challenge in cell biology. Current methods for dissecting the nanoscale spacing either limit themselves to complex survey design using fixed samples or rely on diffraction-limited fluorescence imaging whose spatial resolution is insufficient to quantify distances on the nanoscale. Using dual-color super-resolution STED (stimulated-emission-depletion) microscopy, we here overcome this challenge and accurately measure the density distribution of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the distance between the actin cortex and the membrane in live Jurkat T-cells. We found an asymmetric cortical actin density distribution with a mean width of 230 (+105/-125) nm. The spatial distances measured between the maximum density peaks of the cortex and the membrane were bi-modally distributed with mean values of 50 +/- 15 nm and 120 +/- 40 nm, respectively. Taken together with the finite width of the cortex, our results suggest that in some regions the cortical actin is closer than 10 nm to the membrane and a maximum of 20 nm in others.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 7103, "input": "Background: Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the main etiological agent of tegumentary leishmaniasis in the Americas. Parasite molecular diversity and host immune status contribute to extensive variations in its clinical presentation within endemic areas of Brazil. Pentavalent antimonials have been used for more than 60 years as the first-line drug for all cases, despite the potential for severe side effects and refractoriness. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, most L. (V.) braziliensis infections are benign with a scarcity of parasites, although metastasis and refractory infections can arise. In this scenario, the use of novel molecular tools can be useful for diagnosis and to assess tissue parasitism, and is of benefit to clinical and therapeutic management. Methods: In this study, parasite load was assessed by real-time PCR based on the leishmanial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Results and conclusion: The data revealed a tendency to higher tissue parasitism in the skin compared to mucous lesion sites and a reduction with disease progression. Parasite load was lower in poor compared to good responders to antimonials, and was also reduced in recurrent lesions compared to primary ones. However, parasite load became higher with sequential relapses, pointing to an immune system inability to control the infection. Therefore the parasite burden does not seem to be a good predictor of disease progression. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Working hypothesis: Other factors may influence the risk of PH among adolescences and children born premature. Study design: This national registry-based study assess risk of PH following premature birth adjusted for known risk factors. Patient-subject selection and methodology: All cases born 1993-2010, identified by diagnostic codes applicable to PH and retrieved from the Swedish Registry of Congenital Heart Disease (N = 67). Six controls were randomly selected and matched to each case by year of birth and hospital by the Swedish Medical Birth Register (N = 402). Maternal and infant data related to preterm birth, pulmonary diseases, and congenital defects were retrieved. The association between preterm birth and pulmonary hypertension was calculated by conditional logistic regression taking into account potential confounding factors. Results: One third of the cases and seven percent of the controls were born preterm in our study. Preterm birth was associated with PH, OR = 8.46 (95% CI 2.97-24.10) (P < 0.0001) even after adjusting for confounding factors. Other factors, such as acute pulmonary diseases, congenital heart defects, congenital diaphragm herniation, and chromosomal disorders were also associated with PH in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Children and young adults born preterm are known to have an increased risk of PH, previously explained by congenital heart defects and pulmonary diseases. By adjusting for such factors, our study indicates that new factors may play a role in the risk of developing PH among children born preterm.

Particularly in moments of cross-border violence, Kiryat Shemona becomes a central margin, a place that is crucial to imagining the Israeli nation. For this reason, its inhabitants are imagined by others and often by themselves as steadfast and strong qualities said to be at the center of lsraeliness. At the same time, like other development towns, Kiryat Shemona's residents are mainly Mizrahim who were pushed to populate these marginal regions, and who constitute a majority of the Israeli Jewish population but also in many respects constitute an under-class vis-a-vis the historically Ashkenazi elite. Mizrahim, in such development towns, are thus marginal to the center of power, and vulnerable to the insecurity and poverty associated with these towns. While inhabiting precarious borderlands, they are crucial to the imagining of a bounded Jewish Israeli nation that must defend itself. This article demonstrates how Mizrahim strived to move themselves symbolically from the margins of exclusion to the center of inclusion by calling upon the nation and cosmopolitan connections.

Our objective was to measure the associations between parenting self-efficacy, parent depressive symptoms, and preschool child behaviors that support healthy growth. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled trial. Parenting self-efficacy was measured using a 5-item version of the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC-5) scale (alpha= 0.8). Parent depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CESD) scale. Child outcomes included diet (24 h diet recall), physical activity (accelerometry), sleep (parent-report), and media use during meals (parent-report). We performed separate multiple linear regressions for each outcome controlling for other covariates. Results The sample consisted of 601 parent-child pairs. Median child age was 4.3 (IQR 3.6-5.1) years; median child body mass index (BMI) percentile was 79.1% (IQR 66.8-88.5%); 90% of children were Hispanic/Latino, and 6% of children were non-Hispanic Black. Median parent age was 31.5 (IQR 27.6-36.0) years; 22% of parents met criteria for depression. Parenting self-efficacy (median PSOC-5 25; IQR 24-28) was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (rho = -0.16; p < 0.001). In adjusted models, higher parenting self-efficacy was associated with duration of child's sleep and fewer meals eaten in front of a TV (p < 0.001).

However, there is a lack of empirical research documenting the impact of self-evaluative emotion on 3- and 4-year-olds' prosociality. Extant research relates children's experiences of guilt to empathetic concern and making amends. However, the relationship between guilt and both concern and making amends is potentially reductive. Empathetic concern involves similar bodily expressions to guilt, and amend making is used to distinguish guilt from shame in children. This is the first study to relate the development of both positive and negative self-evaluative emotions to empathetic concern and prosocial choice (making amends and spontaneous help). Results confirm that the broad capacity for self-evaluative emotion is established during the preschool years and relates to empathetic concern. Moreover, these social emotions can be used to predict prosocial choice. Making amends was best predicted by empathetic concern and by children's responses to achievement (pride following success and lack of shame following failure). Alongside moral pride, pride in response to achievement and resilience to shame was also the best predictor of spontaneous help. The data support the idea that young children's prosocial choices may be partially driven by the affective drive to maintain an \"ideal\" self. Psychologists have emphasized that in order to be adaptive, self-evaluative emotion should be guilt oriented rather than shame oriented. However, the adaptive role of pride has been neglected. We call on future research to redress the focus on negative self-evaluation in moral development and further explore the prosocial potential of pride. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In mammals, the photoperiodic signal is mediated by a change in the duration of melatonin, leading to alterations in gene expressions, neuronal circuits, and hormonal secretion. The hippocampus is one of the most plastic structures in the adult brain and hippocampal neuronal morphology displays photoperiod-induced differences. Because the hippocampus is important for emotional and cognitive behaviors, photoperiod-driven remodeling of hippocampal neurons is implicated in seasonal differences of affect, including seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in humans. Because neuronal architecture is also affected by the day-night cycle in several brain areas, we hypothesized that hippocampal neuronal morphology would display a diurnal rhythm and that day length would influence that rhythm. In the present study, we examined diurnal and seasonal differences in hippocampal neuronal morphology, as well as mRNA expression of the neurotrophic factors (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor [Bdnf], tropomyosin receptor kinase B [trkB; a receptor for BDNF], and vascular endothelial growth factor [Vegf]) and a circadian clock gene, Bmal1, in the hippocampus of Siberian hamsters. Diurnal rhythms in total length of dendrites, the number of primary dendrites, dendritic complexity, and distance of the furthest intersection from the cell body were observed only in long-day animals; however, diurnal rhythms in the number of branch points and mean length of segments were observed only in short-day animals. Spine density of dendrites displayed diurnal rhythmicity with different peak times between the CA1 and DG subregions and between long and short days. These results indicate that photoperiod affects daily morphological changes of hippocampal neurons and the daily rhythm of spine density, suggesting the possibility that photoperiod-induced adjustments of hippocampal neuronal dynamics might underlie seasonal difference of affective responses.

Die Einteilung der verschiedenen Stilrichtungen erfolgt anhand des Impacts in Voll-, Halb- und Lowkontakt. Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Analyse von Sportverletzungen im Kyokushinkai- (Vollkontakt) und traditionellem Karate (Semikontakt). Methoden: Im Rahmen einer Querschnittsbefragung wurden insgesamt 215 aktive Amateurkarateka (114 Vollkontakt- und 101 Semikontaktkarateka) mittels eines standardisierten Fragebogens nach sportarttypischen Verletzungen der letzten 36 Monate befragt. Die Verletzungen wurden nach Verletzungsschwere in vier Gruppen unterteilt. Schweregrad I bedeutete, dass keine arztliche Behandlung erfolgte, Schweregrad II beinhaltete eine einmalige arztliche Behandlung, Schweregrad III eine mehrfache ambulante medizinische Behandlung und bei Schweregrad IV erfolgte eine stationare Behandlung. Ergebnisse: 217 Verletzungen wurden im Einzelnen beschrieben wobei 125 Verletzungen (58%) bei Vollkontakt- und 92 Verletzungen (42%) bei Semikontaktkarateka auftraten. Es ergab sich eine expositionszeitbezogene Verletzungsrate von 1,9/1000 Stunden fur Vollkontakt- und 1,3/1000 Stunden fur Semikontaktkarateka (p<0,05). Die haufigsten Verletzungsarten waren muskuloskelettale Kontusionen (33% Vollkontaktkarate; 20% Semikontaktkarate), gefolgt von Distorsionen mit 19 bzw. 16%. Die untere Extremitat war bei den Vollkontaktkarateka mit 40% doppelt so haufig betroffen wie bei Semikontaktkarateka (20%). 80% der Vollkontakt- und 77% der Semikontaktkarateka gaben an, sich wahrend des Trainings verletzt zu haben. Sowohl im Training als auch im Wettkampf kam es beim Kumite (Freikampf) zu den meisten Verletzungen. 75% der Verletzungen bei Vollkontakt- und 70% bei Semikontaktkarateka entfielen auf leichte Verletzungen (Grad I oder II). Schlussfolgerung: Die hohe Verletzungsrate im Training und im Kumite (Freikampf) weist auf spezifische Praventionsziele hin. Hier sollte verstarkt auf propriozeptives Training und auf ein konsequentes Aufwarmen Wert gelegt werden. Zur Pravention im Wettkampf selbst kommt den Schiedsrichtern eine wichtige Aufgabe zu. Abstract Background: Karate enjoys great popularity both in professional and recreational sports and can be classified into full, half and low contact styles. The aim of this study was the analysis of sports injuries in Kyokushinkai (full contact) and traditional Karate (semi-contact). Methods: In a retrospective study design, 215 active amateur karateka (114 full contact, 101 semi-contact) were interviewed by means of a standardised questionnaire regarding typical sport injuries during the last 36 months. Injuries were categorised into severity grade I (not requiring medical treatment), grade II (single medical treatment), grade III (several outpatient medical treatments) and grade IV (requiring hospitalisation). Results: In total, 217 injuries were reported in detail. 125 injuries (58%) occurred in full contact and 92 (42%) in semi-contact karate. The time related injury rate of full contact karateka was 1.9/1000h compared to 1.3/1000h of semi-contact karateka (p<0.05). The most common types of injuries were musculoskeletal contusions (33% full contact, 20% semi-contact), followed by articular sprains with 19% and 16%. The lower extremity was affected twice as often in full contact (40%) as in semi-contact (20%) karate. Training injuries were reported by 80% of the full contact and 77% of the semi-contact karateka. Most injuries, both in training and competition, occurred in kumite. 75% of the reported injuries of full contact and 70% of semi-contact karateka were classified as low grade (I or II). Conclusion: The high rate of injuries during training and kumite (sparring) points to specific prevention goals. The emphasis should be put on proprioceptive training and consistent warm-up.In the actual competition the referees play a vital role regarding prevention.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 2492, "input": "Aims A previous study has reported a significant month-of-birth effect on mood seasonality in the northern hemisphere. Higher mood seasonality was observed for university students born during spring or summer months (long photoperiod) compared to those born during autumn or winter months (short photoperiod). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesized photoperiod effect by comparing the correlation between month of birth and mood seasonality in two countries located at the opposite poles of the terrestrial globe: Italy (northern hemisphere) and New Zealand (southern hemisphere). On the basis of the photoperiod-at-birth hypothesis, we expected to find higher mood seasonality among individuals born in months with longer photoperiods in both countries. Methods The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire was administered to 1514 young adults (1088 women, 426 men; 1027 Italians, 487 New Zealanders), with ages ranging from 18 to 34 years. The Global Seasonality Score, which is a measure of mood seasonality, was calculated from the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire. Results A significant overall month-of-birth effect was observed on the Global Seasonality Score, but only for men. Men born in April and August (corresponding in Italy to a long photoperiod, in New Zealand to a short photoperiod) had higher mood seasonality than those born in February, regardless of country.

Geotextile materials often act as separator and a filter layer between rocks laid above and subgrade beneath. This versatile material has gradually substituted traditional granular materials because of its ease of installation, consistent quality and labour cost efficiency. However, geotextiles often suffer damage during installation due to high dynamic bulk loading of rock placement. This can degrade geotextiles' mechanical strength. The properties considered in this paper include the impact resistance and retained strength of geotextiles. In general, the greater the impact energy applied to geotextiles, the greater the potential for damage. Results highlight the inadequacy of using index derived values as an indicator to determine geotextile performance on site because test results shows that geotextiles (staple fibre (SF) and continuous filament (CF)) with better mechanical properties did not outperform lower mechanical strength materials. The toughest CF product with a CBR index value of 9696N shows inferior impact resistance compared to SF product with the least CBR strength (2719N) given the same impact energy of 9.02 kJ. Test results also indicated that the reduction of strength for CF materials were much greater (between 20 and 50%) compared to SF materials (between 0 and 5%) when subjected to the same impact energy of 4.52 kJ.

Frequently, athletes perceive \"excessive training\" as the principal factor in their injury, an observation that is biologically plausible yet somewhat ambiguous. If the applied training load is suddenly increased, this may increase the risk for sports injury development, irrespective of the absolute amount of training. Indeed, little to no rigorous scientific evidence exists to support the hypothesis that fluctuations in training load, compared to absolute training load, are more important in explaining sports injury development. One reason for this could be that prospective data from scientific studies should be analyzed in a different manner. Time-to-event analysis is a useful statistical tool in which to analyze the influence of changing exposures on injury risk. However, the potential of time-to-event analysis remains insufficiently exploited in sports injury research. Therefore, the purpose of the present article was to present and discuss measures of association used in time-to-event analyses and to present the advanced concept of time-varying exposures and outcomes. In the paper, different measures of association, such as cumulative relative risk, cumulative risk difference, and the classical hazard rate ratio, are presented in a nontechnical manner, and suggestions for interpretation of study results are provided.

Based on this hypothesis, we investigate whether AAU is a risk factor in developing AS later by using National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Materials and Methods: This cohort comparison study used longitudinal Taiwanese NHIRD to probe the relative risk odds of AAU for AS development, and consisted of all patients diagnosed with AAU (n = 5621) (ICD-9-CM codes 364.00). The relative risks of AS between AAU patients and controls were compared by estimating the crude hazard ratio with logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative incidence rates of developing AS, and a log-rank test was used to analyze the differences between the survival curves. Separate Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to compute the AS-free rate after adjusting for possible confounding factors such as age and sex. Results: The crude hazard ratio was 2.667 for the AAU group, and the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.705 for the AAU group. The observation time of the AS-free group was shorter for AAU patients compared with the control group (1507 versus 1578 days). Moreover, in the AAU patients, the younger age onset of AAU (less than 30 years old here) would lead to an earlier diagnosis of AS later with a median of 1445.5 (742-2241) versus 1544 (819-2289) days of survival for the group of age onset of AAU greater than 30 years old.

Methods: A Phase 2 trial and a Phase 3 trial were conducted at seven centers in Texas, USA during the Mountain Cedar pollen season. Both were prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active-referenced (cetirizine) studies. The Phase 2 trial assessed setipiprant 100-1000 mg b.i.d. and 1000 mg o.d. versus placebo in adult and elderly participants. The Phase 3 trial assessed setipiprant 1000 mg b.i.d. in adolescent, adult, and elderly participants. Efficacy was assessed using daytime nasal symptom scores (DNSS), night-time nasal symptom scores (NNSS) and daytime eye symptom scores (DESS). Results: 579 participants were randomized in the Phase 2 trial (mean age 41.6-43.4 years); 630 were randomized in the Phase 3 trial (mean age 37.5-40.7 years). A statistically significant, dose-related improvement in mean change from baseline DNSS was observed over 2 weeks with setipiprant 1000 mg b.i.d. versus placebo in the Phase 2 trial (-0.15 [95% CI-0.29, -0.01]; p = 0.030).

Currently, there is no clear consensus on whether or not a forensic medical history should consistently be considered an integral element within the paediatric forensic evaluation. This study examines the value derived by the medical practitioner taking a forensic medical history rather than relying on hearsay evidence when a child presents for an assessment. Methods: A retrospective review of paediatric cases seen by the Victorian Forensic Paediatric Medical Service (VFPMS) between 2014 and 2015 was undertaken. 274 forensic case reports were reviewed and the data was entered into an Excel spread sheet and analysed using chi squared tests within STATA (R). Results: With increasing age of the child, a forensic medical history is significantly more likely to be taken. Additional information is made available to the medical practitioner what would otherwise have been provided if the medical practitioner relied only on the interview conducted by the police. Discrepancies observed between the official third parties (police or child protection) report of what a child has said and what the child says to the medical practitioner decrease with age, as do discrepancies observed between the child's version of events and a third party's (eg. parents, caregivers, friends) version of events. Conclusions: The study showed that by taking a forensic medical history from the child additional information can be obtained.

Methods: Herein, we examinined several chemokines in colorectal cancer patients using chemokine ELISA array. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect expression of CXCL5 in colorectal cancer patients tissues. Human HCT116 and SW480 cell lines stably transfected with CXCL5, shCXCL5 and shCXCR2 lentivirus plasmids were used in our in vitro study. Immunoblot, immunofluorescence and transwell assay were used to examine the molecular biology and morphological changes in these cells. In addition, we used nude mice to detect the influence of CXCL5 on tumor metastasis in vivo. Results: We found that CXCL5 was overexpressed in tumor tissues and associated with advanced tumor stage as well as poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. We also demonstrated that CXCL5 was primarily expressed in the tumor cell cytoplasm and cell membranes, which may indicate that the CXCL5 was predominantly produced by cancer epithelial cells instead of fibroblasts in the tumor mesenchyme. Additionally, overexpression of CXCL5 enhanced the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of the ERK/Elk-1/Snail pathway and the AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathway in a CXCR2-dependent manner. The silencing of Snail and beta-catenin attenuated CXCL5/CXCR2-enhanced cell migration and invasion in vitro.

Main methods: Bone marrow-derived monocytes/-macrophages (BMM) were exposed to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mu M beta-carotene, followed by evaluation of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and resorption pits formation. Key factors in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways were evaluated with western blot after BMM cells were exposed to RANKL and beta-carotene. The effects of beta-carotene in nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), c-Fos and cathepsin K (CTSK) expression were also evaluated. Key findings: beta-Carotene significantly inhibited BMM viability and promoted LDH release at concentrations of 0.4 and 0.6 mu M. A decrease in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and resorption was also observed after beta-carotene treatment. beta-Carotene attenuated the NF-kappa B pathway activation by RANKL, with no effect on MAPK pathway. beta-Carotene suppressed the upregulation of NFATc1 and c-Fos by RANKL. Significance: We clarified the anti-osteoclastogenic role of beta-carotene, which is mediated by NF-kappa B signaling. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Notwithstanding familiarity with the condition at that time, treatments were largely ineffective, often harmful and never evidence-based, and it was not until 100 years later with the identification and description of estrogen and progesterone that effective treatments became available. So efficacious were hormone therapies for menopausal symptoms that their prescription was often recommended for all postmenopausal women regardless of their needs, wishes or health status. For many there was benefit but for some there was harm. It was in this environment that a small group of clinicians determined to form an International Menopause Society (IMS) to conduct research into the appropriate use of hormone therapy in treating menopause symptoms, to hold regular congresses to educate colleagues and discuss research results and thus to improve the health and well-being of women in midlife and beyond. Formed in 1978, the IMS is now recognized as the global leader in its field, working towards these goals in collaboration with colleagues and other national and regional societies concerned with women's health. During that time, the IMS has been led by 13 Presidents and has conducted 15 World Congresses on the Menopause, all of which are reviewed in this paper.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 19306, "input": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a large number of nodes are densely deployed in an open environment to gather some useful required information. These nodes are small in size, operating on limited processing capabilities with scarce working memory and battery life and not very powerful radio transceivers. They can only communicate with each other through wireless media. Radio waves are insecure in nature; therefore, by using such waves for communication there are always opportunities for different attacks on the network. Most wireless techniques are founded on the cluster-based sensor network. Forwarding cluster head's (CHs) data in a secure manner is very important because CHs collect data from the cluster members and send it to the sink node or base station. For securing CH's data, we propose a mechanism termed ICMDS (Inter-Cluster Multiple Key Distribution Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks), which enables the securing of the entire network. In ICMDS, we use two phases of security implementations for the sensor node's authenticity while communicating with the CH. A recovery phenomena is also stated at the time when a CH ceases to function due to its high energy consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a model was developed to calculate the draft force and power of a disk plow. In this model, the effects of soil cutting, soil displacement, and soil-metal friction processes on the specific draft force of a disk plow were considered. Model inputs consisted of the soil parameters, the plow parameters, and the working condition parameters. To simplify the required calculations, the derived equations were entered in the Excel software, and the finalized spreadsheet was utilized as the disk plow draft force and power calculator. One of the advantages of the developed model was that the required calculations did not depend upon the dimensionless N-factors. Model verification was carried out by comparing the model outputs with the corresponding results of other studies. Moreover, the output of the model and the measured draft force of plowing on a silty clay loam soil were compared. According to the results of this study, the form of equation developed in this paper and the Hendrick's formula regarding the specific draft force, were compatible, since both equations were polynomials of order 2 with respect to the forward velocity of the plow. On the other hand, the developed model overestimated the required draft force of a disk blade in comparison with the Godwin's model; however, the average value of overestimation was only 18%. Moreover, draft force and power requirements of a three-blade disk plow working on a silty clay loam soil with the forward velocity of 7 km h(-1), were 11.3 kN, and 22 kW, respectively, that were about 5% lower than the results obtained by the developed model (11.8 kN, and 22.95 kW).

It typically follows a chronic course and patients undergo longterm medical and surgical therapy. We set out to describe current surgical practice in the management of pCD in the UK. Method A survey of surgical management of pCD was designed by an expert group of colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists. This assessed acute, elective, multidisciplinary and definitive surgical management. A pilot of the questionnaire was undertaken at the 2015 meeting of the Digestive Disease Federation. The survey was refined and distributed nationally through the trainee collaborative networks. Results National rollout obtained responses from 133 of 179 surgeons approached (response rate 74.3%). At first operation, 32% of surgeons would always consider drainage of sepsis and 31.1% would place a draining seton. At first elective operation, 66.6% would routinely insert of draining seton, and 84.4% would avoid cutting seton. An IBD multidisciplinary team was available to 87.6% of respondents, although only 25.1% routinely discussed pCD patients. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy was routinely considered by 64.2%, although 44.2% left medical management to gastroenterologists. Common definitive procedures were removal of the seton only (70.7%), fistulotomy (57.1%), advancement flap (38.9%), fistula plug (36.4%) and ligation of intersphincteric track (LIFT) procedure (31.8%). Indications for diverting stoma or proctectomy were intractable sepsis, incontinence and poor quality of life.

However, to our knowledge, no study has yet evaluated the results of neuromodulation on a sessionby- session basis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of complete response of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for each session of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), in a protocol of 20 sessions of therapy. Method This is a prospective study of the improvement of LUTS in children with isolated OAB. Included in this study were children over the age of 4 years who complained of urinary urgency, had bell-or-tower-shaped uroflowmetry patterns, and post-void residual <10% of expected capacity for their age and/or less than 20 mL. No patient was treated with an anticholinergic. Children were excluded with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to urinary tract abnormalities. All patients underwent parasacral transcutaneous neurostimulation (TENS). The development of symptoms was observed right before each session using a visual analog scale (VAS) in which 0 means the absence of improvement and 10 represents maximum improvement of symptoms. Results We noted a complete resolution of symptoms (urgency, urge incontinence, frequency, and holding maneuvers) in some patients starting after the third session. In the 10th and 20th (last) sessions, 12 (17.4%) and 38 (55.1%) patients reported a complete resolution of symptoms. After complete resolution, 12 (17.4%) patients reported that their symptoms worsened to a minimum level of 40% improvement, but this was temporary and all returned to 100% improvement. Children who showed an improvement level greater than 50% in the fifth treatment session were 4.18 (p = 0.007) times more likely to have success in the last treatment session. Conclusion We found that a patient can experience complete symptom resolution as quickly as following the third session of TENS. The complete response rate progressively increases with the number of sessions, slowly until the 12th session and more rapidly after that. When symptom improvement of at least 50% is reported in the fifth session, there is a higher chance that the patient will have full resolution of symptoms at the end of treatment.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 32174, "input": "State recognition in disconnecting switches is important during substation automation.

This is contrary to debris-covered glaciers in other parts of High Asia, where stagnant glacier tongues are common. Our feature tracking results for the 2013/2014 period suggest an average deceleration of 51% when compared with published Landsat velocities for the period 1999/2003.

Rat cardiomyocytes were divided into 3 groups: normal glucose group (NG group), HG group and HG +exendin-4 group (HG+Ex Group). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by double-staining with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry.

HG treatment induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.00) and clearly upregulated ROS production (P = 0.00); exendin-4 co-incubation also ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.004) and decreased ROS (P = 0.00) level significantly. HO-1 and Nrf-2 protein expression levels decreased significantly in the HG group (P < 0.05), but the levels were elevated by exendin-4 intervention (P < 0.05).

Material and methods: Of 1563 patients with primary immunodeficiencies diagnosed in the Department of Immunology, the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), 66 boys had a provisional diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia. Forty-four subjects fulfilled definitive ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiencies) diagnostic criteria of XLA. A retrospective analysis of medical history of XLA patients was undertaken. Results: Recurrent respiratory tract infections, particularly bronchitis (73%) and pneumonia (59%), were the most common symptoms of XLA. The GI disorders constituted the next main manifestation (63.6%), followed by upper respiratory tract infections. Twenty-six of 28 XLA patients with GI disorders complained of diarrhea, which was resolved generally after immunoglobulin therapy introduction. Single but prolonged episodes of Campylobacter jejuni diarrhea were reported in two individuals. Inflammatory bowel disease of mild to moderate activity was diagnosed in 1 patient, and local enteritis of mild activity in another one. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal disorders were one of the main manifestations of XLA, reported almost as often as lower respiratory tract infections.

Methods: Sports-related injury data for the 2005-2006 through 2013-2014 academic years from a national convenience sample of high schools participating in the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School Reporting Information Online [RIO]) were analyzed. Results: Certified athletic trainers participating in High School RIO reported 115 of 1246 (9.2%) elbow injuries as elbow dislocations. A total of 30,415,179 athlete exposures (AEs) were reported during the study period, resulting in a dislocation rate of 0.38 per 100,000 AEs. The majority of the dislocations resulted from boys' wrestling (46.1%) and football (37.4%). Elbow dislocation rates were higher in competition than in practice. Also, 91.3% of dislocations occurred in boys' sports. Among both boys (60.4%) and girls (88.9%), the majority of injuries occurred during varsity sports activities.

Quantitative microbial community dynamics were evaluated as a function of time and electrical performance using 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic microarrays and flow cytometry. Results show that the bacterial community stabilized partially but not completely when voltage output was stable. Geobacter appeared to be the predominant genus, whose growth was associated with voltage, while some other genus still developed or declined after the voltage stabilization. Flow cytometry revealed that some genus showing a decreasing proportional fluorescence intensity over time were still actively respiring bacteria, and thus, active albeit minor members of the biofilm.

This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the limited motor torque control and the performance of the power-on upshift control in electric vehicles. First, a simplified model for an electric vehicle powertrain with a general two-speed automatic transmission was built. Then, a power-on upshift control strategy was introduced into the powertrain model, with the aim of a constant output torque during power-on upshifts. The control strategy fully utilized the control flexibility of electric motors and specifically focused on the effects of the limited motor torque control during power-on upshifts. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed control strategy could significantly improve the shift quality of electric vehicles under mild driving conditions. However, the performance of the proposed control strategy under aggressive driving conditions was impaired by the limited motor torque control. An effective solution was proposed to improve the performance of the power-on upshift control under aggressive driving conditions.

Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus were taken at baseline and 12 months after AHSCT or insulin-only therapy. The lymphocyte proliferation, mRNA expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to T-helper type 1 (Th1), T-helper type 17 (Th17) and regulatory T (Treg) cells in PBMC culture supernatants were assessed. Results: Compared with patients receiving insulin-only treatment, the patients receiving AHSCT treatment showed better residual C-peptide secretion, lower anti-GAD titers and less exogenous insulin dosages after 12 months of follow-up. AHSCT treatment was associated with significantly reduced Th1 and Th17 cell proportions as well as decreased IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-12p40 and IL-17A levels in the PBMC culture supernatants (all P < 0.05). Although there was no significant Treg cell expansion after AHSCT treatment, we observed increased IL-10, TGF-beta and Foxp3 mRNA expression and increased TGF-beta levels. However, we found no significant changes in the T-cell subpopulations after insulin treatment, except for higher IL-12p40 mRNA expression and a lower proportion of Treg cells.

CM remnant particles, as well as oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants, are highly atherogenic and act by enhancing systemic inflammation, platelet activation, coagulation, thrombus formation, and macrophage foam cell formation. The cholesterol levels of remnant lipoproteins significantly correlate with small, dense LDL; impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and CHD prevalence. We have developed an assay of apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 levels to evaluate the accumulation of CM remnants. Fasting apoB-48 levels correlate with the morbidity of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, type. hyperlipoproteinemia, the metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and IGT. Fasting apoB-48 levels also correlate with carotid intima-media thickening and CHD prevalence, and a high apoB-48 level is a significant predictor of CHD risk, independent of the fasting TG level.

Sustainable consumption and production patterns can be associated with implementing and developing reverse logistics system on construction site to close the supply chain of construction materials. Initiating activities are undertaken already at the construction site, conditioning thereby further possibilities of resource recovery, stages of the recovery process, and total costs. Hence, the type, quantity and the quality of waste affect the cost of its collection - which can be a significant item in a project's budget. The paper provides an overview of the existing national recovery systems and waste policies to provide background for the case study. A crucial part of the research is an analysis of three waste management scenarios for a particular construction project. \"Anthropocentric\", \"current\" and \"ecocentric\" approaches were studied in terms of waste collection costs. Two extreme approaches were created as an alternative to usual waste management policy applied on construction site. The \"antropocentric\" approach is a reflection of ill-conceived waste management - assuming no segregation, which leads to high costs of waste processing. The \"ecocentric\" approach, in turn, assumes direct sales of sorted waste at lower prices, and also by reverse logistics within the project, thereby providing cost savings. The results show that policy of waste disposal encourages and even forces entrepreneurs to implement reverse logistics despite the additional duties and requirements. General conclusions of research confirm that currently operating systems of waste management on site are sustainable, but nevertheless, it is still possible to make them more eco-efficient and, at the same time, more profitable.

We investigated the separate and interactive associations of trauma and depression on neurocognition in a sample of ethnically diverse urban dwellers, and explored the impact of age on these effects. Methods: 284 adults aged 30-89 were divided into groups based on their current depression and trauma history. Individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for depression were considered Depressed (D+) and individuals rated through diagnostic interview as having trauma history were considered positive for Trauma (T+). Resulting Ns were 73 D+T+, 56 D+T-, 68 D-T+, and 87 D-T-. A principal component analysis of neuropsychological scores resulted in a 3-factor solution representing verbal learning/memory/recognition (VERBAL-LMR), visual learning/memory/recognition, and speeded attention/cognitive flexibility accounting for 70.21% of the variance. Results: Multivariable linear regressions adjusting for age revealed that Trauma, regardless of Depression, is associated with worse VERBAL-LMR performance. This Trauma association was driven by verbal list and prose passages learning and memory, but not recognition memory. Age-stratified (= 60 years) regressions revealed the Trauma association was only significant for older adults. No main or interactive effects for Depression were observed. Conclusions: Trauma, regardless of Depression, is associated with worse verbal learning and memory, but not recognition performance. These results suggest that trauma exposure may negatively impact neurocognition. Clinicians working with adults in urban settings should query for trauma in addition to depression when considering subjective and objective measures of neurocognitive functioning, particularly in older adults.

Because exerting self-regulation is another major lesson parents emphasize, consumers engage in self-regulatory behavior to compensate for a loss of personal control. However, when consumers believe their parents emphasized self-regulation less strongly during childhood (i. e., they believe their parents had a more permissive style), a loss of control can reduce self-regulatory behavior.

To complement these strains, we constructed plasmids with Y. lipolytica-optimized superfolder GFP for targeted overexpression and fluorescent tagging. We used these tools to build the \"Yarrowia lipolytica Cell Atlas,\" a collection of strains with endogenous fluorescently tagged organelles in the same genetic background, in order to define organelle morphology in live cells. Conclusions: These molecular and isogenetic tools are useful for live assessment of organelle-specific protein expression, and for localization of lipid biosynthetic enzymes or other proteins in Y. lipolytica.

For Germany, so far, only top-down analyses of the waste heat potential exist, using key figures derived from other studies in other countries. In this paper, the first bottom-up approach for estimating the industrial waste heat potential in Germany is presented. For this approach, an algorithm to evaluate and test the mandatory emission report data from German production companies was developed. In a second step, round about 81,000 data sets have been evaluated to calculate a conservative and lower boundary value for the industrial waste heat.

Second-generation selective progesterone receptors modulators have been developed and evaluated for EC use. Among these compounds, ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been proven to share the same antiprogestin activity as mifepristone, and as with mifepristone, UPA has been demonstrated to be effective up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. The UPA is more effective than levonorgestrel (LNG) in preventing the appearance of clinically evident pregnancies. The LNG delays ovulation only when taken at the beginning of the fertile period; taken later, it is ineffective on ovulation, while it has been proven to impair the subsequent luteal function. The effectiveness of LNG decreases as time elapses and is limited to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. The UPA maintains consistent effectiveness for 5 days after unprotected intercourse, and this effectiveness is independent on which of these 5 days it is taken. The ability of UPA to delay ovulation decreases progressively as ovulation approaches and is null at the time of the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak: 1 to 2 days before ovulation, UPA behaves as a placebo. The persistent effectiveness of the drug cannot be due to antiovulatory action, as it decreases sharply as LH approaches its peak level. The effectiveness is most likely due to the dramatic endometrial effects of the drug that are produced regardless of when it is taken.

How can genetics provide the tools to address these gaps? Ziegler et al for the GDS Group explore the novel hypothesis that genetic variability in transketolase (TKT) might contribute to susceptibility to DPN in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (well characterised for DPN). Transketolase diverts excess glycolytic metabolites from the hexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation endproduct pathways to the pentose phosphate pathway, with a protective effect against hyperglycaemia-induced damage. Moreover, thiamine and its derivative benfotiamine are among the few disease-modifying agents still under consideration as DPN treatment. The authors find significant associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the TKT gene with the Total Symptom Score and thermal thresholds, in particular in male participants with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, they measure plasma methylglyoxal (a glycating agent, whose availability is hindered by TKT) without however finding a relation with TKT single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The link found between TKT genetic variability and nerve function measures is considered here in the context of DPN genetic studies and of experimental and clinical findings regarding thiamine and benfotiamine.

The joint optimization problem of device-to-device (D2D) caching with channel allocation is formulated as a weighted four-uniform hypergraph model. The optimal solution for the problem is 4-D maximum weighted matching (4-DMWM), which is NP-hard unfortunately. To approach the 4-DMWM with low-complexity, we adopt the greedy algorithm and the squareIMP algorithm in the centralized case. Moreover, distributed algorithms are also designed for the caching problem in both synchronous and asynchronous cases. The simulation results will illustrate that the squareIMP algorithm can be used to get a better transmission rate with the complexity of O(n(5)), while the greedy algorithm can be used in the case with stringent latency requirement for centralized 4-DMWM problem. The sum rate of distributed asynchronous algorithm is close to the centralized greedy algorithm with the complexity of O(n(2)) for each device.

This paper focuses on such a forest insect species, the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. Its caterpillars develop gregariously during winter in a conspicuous silk nest in coniferous hosts. When disturbed, the larvae release urticating hairs that cause human or animal serious health problems. The purpose of our survey was to (1) inventory all individual trees belonging to potential host species and estimate the density of T. pityocampa (2) assess the spatial pattern of the insect population at the city scale. We conducted an exhaustive inventory of potential coniferous host trees in five municipalities (ca. 5000 ha) in the north of Orleans, France. Each tree was identified, geo-referenced and the number of moth nests it hosted was counted. A total of 9321 urban trees representing 11 coniferous taxonomic units were investigated. The distribution of T. pityocampa exhibited a marked spatial structure citywide. Geostatistics allowed to draw risk maps revealing strong patchiness.

MethodsAll patients that underwent a SNM evaluation between 2006 and 2013 and filled out a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) before treatment, were included. Chi-square analysis and bivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations and predictive value. ResultsEighty-six patients were included, 65 females and 21 males. Most patients, 66, had overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). The remaining 20 patients suffered from non-obstructive urinary retention (NOR). Thirty-nine OAB patients and 17 NOR patients, had a normal total HADS score before treatment. Significantly more patients showed abnormal HADS-D (P=0.047) and HADS-A (P=0.015) scores in the OAB group compared to the NOR group. Success of SNM could not be predicted by the HADS score P=0.464 (after 1 year P=0.446). Subsequent analysis revealed that an abnormal HADS score was not related to the occurrence of SNM adverse events. ConclusionsThe present study did not reveal a significant relationship between an abnormal HADS score and failure of the SNM test period in a mixed group of OAB and NOR patients. However, differences between OAB and NOR patients concerning affective symptoms were present. It is known that psychological factors play a role in the severity of LUTS, but they may not predict SNM outcome. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:1011-1016, 2016.

The three-dimensional subsurface flow dynamics are thus described by a two-dimensional equation, allowing for a drastic reduction of model unknowns and simplification of the model parameterizations. This approach is compared with a full resolution of the Richards equation in different synthetic test cases.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, coimmunoprecipitation, confocal imaging, patch-clamp recordings, and TMEM16A endothelial-specific transgenic and knockout mice were used. We found that TMEM16A was expressed abundantly and functioned as a Ca2+-activated Cl-channel in endothelial cells.

The knockout of endothelial-specific TMEM16A significantly lowered the blood pressure and ameliorated endothelial dysfunction in angiotensin II-induced hypertension, whereas the overexpression of endothelial-specific TMEM16A resulted in the opposite effects. These results were related to the increased reactive oxygen species production, Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase activation, and Nox2 and p22phox protein expression that were facilitated by TMEM16A on angiotensin II-induced hypertensive challenge.

The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which off-label AP prescribing in a veteran population was potentially appropriate. DesignExpert panel and retrospective analysis. Data SourceVeterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse. PatientsA total of 69,823 veterans who had at least one pharmacy record for an AP medication during fiscal years 2005-2012. Measurements and Main ResultsAn expert panel was convened to determine if agreement exists on the appropriateness of AP use in various scenarios. The panel consisted of 10 experts in the field of psychiatry: nine physicians with various specialties, and one pharmacist. We used a modified RAND appropriateness method approach to identify potentially appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate cases of AP use. The use of six second-generation APs was examined individually, and the use of first-generation APs was examined as a class. Based on data previously collected quantifying VHA AP use, the panel was given disease state scenarios for the most commonly occurring off-label diagnoses for AP prescriptions. Disease states were coupled with scenario modifiers that the expert panel considered potentially significant clinical factors. Among the four disease statesanxiety, dementia, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder29 scenarios were investigated for each AP. None of the scenarios were judged by the expert panel to be appropriate for the use of APs. Of the 203 scenarios for all APs, 60% were judged to be inappropriate by the expert panel, and the remaining 40% were considered uncertain. Of the AP medications, risperidone (72%) and olanzapine (62%) were the most likely to be seen as uncertain, whereas first-generation APs (86%) were the most likely to be considered inappropriate in a given scenario. Widespread off-label use of APs outside of the approved indications of treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, or adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, may not be an appropriate treatment option. According to this expert panel, no examined situations were considered appropriate for the use of APs. ConclusionThe consensus of our expert panel was that off-label AP use is uncertain at best and more likely, even in complicated cases, inappropriate.

However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

Findings: Of 2,639 participants who completed the injury component, 364 (13.8%) reported injury requiring treatment from a doctor or a hospitalization in the previous 12 months. Of those requiring treatment or hospitalization, 147 (40.4%) reported being injured in a domestic or public setting and 207 (56.9%) in a high-risk setting. The most common types and mechanisms of injury were sprains and strains, and falls, trips and slips, respectively. Preinjury depression was independently associated with unintentional injury in a domestic or public setting. Being injured in this setting was associated with double the odds of experiencing current depressive symptoms. The likelihood of a high-risk setting injury was significantly associated with male gender. High-risk setting injury was associated with current psychological distress and higher levels of alcohol usage. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that pre-existing depression is associated with unintentional injury in a rural sample and indicates the important role of prior depression in management of injury, given the high rate of injury in rural communities. Mechanisms by which prior depression increases likelihood of unintentional injury will be further investigated using longitudinal data.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 15281, "input": "Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons originate the nasal placode and migrate into the brain during prenatal development. Once within the brain, these cells become integral components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, essential for reproductive function. Disruption of this system causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). HH associated with anosmia is clinically defined as Kallman syndrome (KS). Recent work examining the developing nasal region has shed new light on cellular composition, cell interactions and molecular cues responsible for the development of this system in different species. This review discusses some developmental aspects, animal models and current advancements in our understanding of pathologies affecting GnRH.

Similarities of underlying vascular mechanisms between RA and arterial hypertension are interesting and have not been researched in depth. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes of RA and arterial hypertension with the optic coherence topography (OCT) and Heidelberg retina tomography (HRT III), to validate RA changes in comparison to arterial hypertension only patients and, finally, if these methods are useful to detect the chronic inflammatory influence of the RA on the eye. In this prospective study design, data of 18 patients with RA and arterial hypertension (55.3 +/- 4.31 years old), positive for antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides, 21 patients with arterial hypertension (54.2 +/- 4.18 years old) and 19 healthy subjects (53.1 +/- 3.25 years old) were included. Intensive ophthalmologic and internistic screening tests were carried out in all subjects. All participants were investigated for the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula thickness with the OCT (Carl Zeiss AG Germany) and for stereometric parameters of the optic nerve head with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph III (Heidelberg Engineering Germany). The pachymetry was conducted by the Orbscan II system (Bausch & Lomb). Statistical data were assessed by SPSS, v20.0. No significant differences were found in visual function, diastolic and systolic blood pressure. RNFL, and macular thickness (Stratus-OCT) were almost consistent between the groups and even the main stereometric parameters measured with HRT III showed no significant differences. Contrary to our study hypothesis no structural and morphological changes could be detected in patients with arterial hypertension without RA compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, no RA-specific effects could be shown in comparison with the hypertension group.

For this purpose, an experimental quick-return mechanism was constructed with gears driven by an electric motor. Rattling is detected from the mechanical vibrations acceleration and the electric motor current. Vibrations signal is measured by a biaxial accelerometer and electrical current is obtained from the motor electronic driver. Signals are processed in time-domain and time-frequency domain. Rattling level is measured through a proposed performance evaluation index that is obtained from the application of band-pass filters and the RMS value of the signal for the time-domain processing. For the time-frequency analysis, the wavelet transform is used to isolate the rattling and the signal is post-processed to compute the RMS value. It is shown that the use of the electric motor current for the detection of rattling produce better results than the mechanical vibrations acceleration. With respect to the time-domain method versus the time-frequency method, it was found that the application of the wavelet transform significantly improves the indexes that are used for gear-rattle detection.", "class": "Electrical Engineering"}, {"id": 15230, "input": "Glomerulonephritis (GN) is still the most common cause of end-stage renal disease. Accumulation of glomerular macrophages, proliferation of mesangial cells, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins are pathobiological hallmarks of GN. Pharmacological interventions that can inhibit these insults may be beneficial in the retardation of the progression of GN. Honokiol originally isolated from Magnolia officinalis, shows antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative activities in a variety of inflammation models. In this study, we first investigated the in vivo effects of honokiol on rat anti-Thy1 nephritis. Anti-Thy1 nephritis was induced in Wistar rats by injecting mouse anti-rat Thy1 antibodies intravenously. Nephritic rats were randomly assigned to receive honokiol (2.5mg/kg, twice a day) or vehicle and were killed at various time points. Glomerular histology and immunohistopathology and urine protein excretion were studied. Western blotting was conducted for markers of proliferation. Adhesion molecules, chemokine, and extracellular matrix gene expression were evaluated by Northern blotting. Honokiol-treated nephritic rats excreted less urinary protein and had lower glomerular cellularity and sclerosis. The increased intraglomerular proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Akt phosphorylation in nephritic rats could be abolished by the treatment of honokiol. Honokiol also alleviated glomerular monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1, similar to type I (alpha 1) collagen and fibronectin mRNA levels of nephritic rats.

Using previously validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, we identified patients with a cervical artery dissection and no previous or concurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack diagnosis. We compared the risk of stroke in successive 2-week periods during the 12 weeks after dissection versus the corresponding 2-week period 1 year later. Absolute risk increases were calculated using McNemar test for matched data. In a sensitivity analysis, we limited our population to patients presenting with typical symptoms of cervical artery dissection. Results-We identified 2791 patients with dissection without ischemia. The absolute increase in stroke risk was 1.25% (95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.67%) in the first 2 weeks after dissection compared with the same time period 1 year later. The absolute risk increase was 0.18% (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.34%) during weeks 3 to 4 and was no longer significant during the remainder of the 12-week postdissection period.

Birthweight is one measure of perinatal growth that has been investigated as an osteosarcoma risk factor. Whether birthweight affects clinical features of osteosarcoma remains unexplored. Method: Six hundred seventy patients with osteosarcoma, aged 0-19 years, were identified through the California Cancer Registry. We analyzed birth certificate data from the California Department of Public Health vital statistics unit for these patients and 2,860 controls, matched by sex, birth-year, and race/ethnicity. We examined the impact of birthweight on the risk, timing, and clinical presentation of pediatric osteosarcoma including tumor location, size, extension, differentiation, presence of metastasis, and age at onset. Regression models were adjusted for race, sex, gestational age, socioeconomic status, and tumor site. Results: Higher birthweight was associated with more advanced tumor stage (P = 0.017), a trend toward greater tumor extension into surrounding tissues (P = 0.083), and with occurrence of tumors in sites other than the long bones of the arms/legs (P = 9.7 x 10(-3)). Higher birthweight was also associated with an increased likelihood of metastases present at diagnosis (P = 0.047), with each 200 g increase in birthweight associated with a 1.11-fold increase in the odds of having metastatic disease (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.22).

Animals were separated into breeding pairs, one pair per cage and pairs randomly assigned to three experimental groups (ten couples per group): control group were provided cages without any environmental enrichment; PVC group with PVC pipe; and cardboard roll group with a commercially available cardboard tube. To compare the reproductive performance of the three groups, the following were evaluated: number of pups/litter; number of litters; parturition interval; occurrence of cannibalism; weight gain of offspring; as well as the quantity and quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) obtained after superovulation of the females born from the first, second and last pregnancy in all groups. Moreover, the plasma level of corticosterone in breeding animals was measured. A total of 60 male rats randomly selected from the first- and last-born litters (20 males from each group) were first tested in an elevated plus-maze (EPM) and on the following day, were tested in an open field test (OFT). Significant differences were found in the number and morphological classification of COCs. In the control group, the number of oocytes in grade 4 (unusual shapes and very heterogeneous ooplasm, presenting no layers of surrounding cumulus cells [13]) presented statistically higher rates (225/2535, 8.9%) compared to the other groups, as well as the number of competent oocytes was higher in the enriched groups (p = 0.001). Moreover, we find that the males of cardboard roll group differed significantly in weight gain compared to PVC group (p = 0.008). In addition to this, we did not detect occurrence of cannibalism in this group. Our findings suggest that environmental enrichment provides improvements in reproductive performance of Wistar rats.

Memory stimuli comprised two or four real world objects (the memory load) presented sequentially, each for 650 ms, at random locations on a computer screen. After a 1000 ms retention interval, a test display was presented, comprising an empty box at one of the previously presented two or four memory stimulus locations. Participants were asked to report the name of the object presented at the cued location. Errors rates wherein participants reported the names of objects that had been presented in the memory display but not at the cued location (non-target errors) vs. objects that had not been presented at all in the memory display (non-memory errors) were compared. Significant effects of aging, memory load and target recency on error type and absolute error rates were found. Non-target error rate was higher than non-memory error rate in both age groups, indicating that VSTM may have been more often than not populated with partial traces of previously presented items. At high memory load, non-memory error rate was higher in young participants (compared to older participants) when the memory target had been presented at the earliest temporal position. However, non-target error rates exhibited a reversed trend, i.e., greater error rates were found in older participants when the memory target had been presented at the two most recent temporal positions.

For instance, the electromechanical impedance technique employing smart piezo-impedance transducer (lead zirconate titanate) is known for its sensitivity in detecting damage. The admittance signatures of the electromechanical impedance technique for structural health monitoring are susceptible to variation in the static load applied on the host structure, which should not be ignored. This article presents a series of experimental, analytical, and numerical studies conducted to investigate the effect of varying axial load in the presence of fixed boundary condition on the admittance signatures. Theoretically, the extensional vibration is not affected by any static axial load acting in the same direction. However, it is useful in identifying the effect of stiffening caused by the boundary condition upon increase in the axial force, which contributes to the discrepancy between the experiments and the analytical models. This study suggests that the effect of boundary condition is substantial, which should be carefully considered in real-life application of the electromechanical impedance technique for structural health monitoring.", "class": "Civil Engineering"}, {"id": 24984, "input": "Objective: To compare initial and recurrent concussions regarding average number of days between concussions, acute concussion symptoms and symptom resolution time, and return to play time.

Measures: Number of days between concussions, number of symptoms endorsed, specific symptoms endorsed, symptom resolution time, return to play time. Results: Median time between initial and recurrent concussions was 21 days (interquartile range = 10-43 days).

It is rich in the tryptamine hallucinogens dimethyltryptamine [DMT], which acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A agonist. This mechanism of action is similar to other compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin. The controlled use of LSD and psilocybin in experimental settings is associated with a low incidence of psychotic episodes, and population studies corroborate these findings. Both the controlled use of DMT in experimental settings and the use of ayahuasca in experimental and ritual settings are not usually associated with psychotic episodes, but little is known regarding ayahuasca or DMT use outside these controlled contexts. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the published case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca and DMT intake. We found three case series and two case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca intake, and three case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with DMT. Several reports describe subjects with a personal and possibly a family history of psychosis [including schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, psychotic mania, psychotic depression], nonpsychotic mania, or concomitant use of other drugs. However, some cases also described psychotic episodes in subjects without these previous characteristics. Overall, the incidence of such episodes appears to be rare in both the ritual and the recreational/noncontrolled settings. Performance of a psychiatric screening before administration of these drugs, and other hallucinogens, in controlled settings seems to significantly reduce the possibility of adverse reactions with psychotic symptomatology.

Also, after diosgenin application, the volume density of the zona reticularis (expressed per volume of adrenal cortex) and the zona reticularis cell volume were decreased by 51% and 20% (p <0.05) respectively, compared to C animals. Our results, reflecting a decrease in many stereological parameters of the adrenal cortex, indicate that diosgenin took over the role of corticosteroid precursors and became incorporated into steroidogenesis.

This group of patients presents complex challenges to clinical services, and a treatment which addresses their multiple problems has the potential to improve outcome. MBT has been shown to be effective in improving outcome in patients with BPD, but its use has not been reported in ED. Methods: Sixty-eight eligible participants were randomised to MBT-ED or SSCM-ED. The primary outcome measure was the global score on the Eating Disorder Examination. Secondary outcomes included measures of BPD symptoms (the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder), general psychiatric state, quality of life and service utilisation. Participants were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after randomisation. Analysis was performed using linear mixed models. Results: Only 15 participants (22 %) completed the 18 month follow-up. Early drop-out occurred significantly more in the SSCM-ED group. Drop-out did not vary with treatment model later in therapy and was sometimes attributed to participants moving away. There was higher drop-out amongst smokers and those with higher neuroticism scores. 47.1 % of participants in the MBT-ED arm and 37.1 % in the SSCM-ED arm attended at least 50 % of therapy sessions offered. Amongst those remaining in the trial, at 12 and 18 months MBT-ED was associated with a greater reduction in Shape Concern and Weight Concern in the Eating Disorder Examination compared to SSCM-ED. At 6, 12 and 18 months there was a decline of ED and BPD symptoms in both groups combined. Ten participants were reported as having had adverse events during the trial, mostly self-harm, and there was one death, attributed as 'unexplained' by the coroner. Conclusions: The high drop-out rate made interpretation of the results difficult.

Data source: The search was performed in the Bireme database, using the terms: children's health, environmental exposure, health vulnerability, toxicity pathways and developmental disabilities in the LILACS, MEDLINE and SciELO systems. Data synthesis: Children differ from adults in their unique physiological and behavioral characteristics and the potential exposure to risks caused by several threats in the environment. Exposure to toxic agents is analyzed through toxicokinetic processes in the several systems and organs during the sensitive phases of child development. The caused effects are reflected in the increased prevalence of congenital malformations, diarrhea, asthma, cancer, endocrine and neurological disorders, among others, with negative impacts throughout adult life. Conclusion: To identify the causes and understand the mechanisms involved in the genesis of these diseases is a challenge for science, as there is still a lack of knowledge on children's susceptibility to many environmental contaminants. Prevention policies and more research on child environmental health, improving the recording and surveillance of environmental risks to children's health, should be an ongoing priority in the public health field.

Cryptosporidium oocyst concentration and species/genotype data were collected from three surface water surveillance programs in two river basins [South Nation River, SN (2004-09) and Grand River, GR (2005-13)] in Ontario, Canada to evaluate seasonal infection risks. Main river stems, tributaries, agricultural drainage streams, water treatment plant intakes, and waste water treatment plant effluent impacted sites were sampled. The QMRA employed two sets of exposure data to compute risk: one assuming all observed oocysts were infectious to humans, and the other based on the fraction of oocysts that were C hominis and/or C. parvum (dominant human infectious forms of the parasite). Viability was not considered and relative infection risk was evaluated using a single hypothetical recreational exposure. Many sample site groupings for both river systems, had significant seasonality in Cryptosporidium occurrence and concentrations (p < 0.05); occurrence and concentrations were generally highest in autumn for SN, and autumn and summer for GR. Mean risk values (probability of infection per exposure) for all sites combined, for each river system, were roughly an order of magnitude lower (avg. of SN and GR 5.3 x 10(-5)) when considering just C parvum and C hominis oocysts, in relation to mean infection risk (per exposure) assuming all oocysts were infectious to humans (5.5 x 10(-4)). Seasonality in mean risk (targeted human infectious oocysts only) was most strongly evident in SN (e.g., 7.9 x 10(-6) in spring and 8.1 x 10(-5) in summer). Such differences are important if QMRA is used to quantify effects of water safety/quality management practices where inputs from a vast array of fecal pollution sources can readily occur. Cryptosporidium seasonality in water appears to match the seasonality of human infections from Cryptosporidium in the study regions. This study highlights the importance of Cryptosporidium species/genotype data to help determine surface water pollution sources and seasonality, as well as to help more accurately quantify human infection risks by the parasite.

The efficiency of energy conversion processes is one of the most important factors affecting the path to such a goal. This paper provides a framework for the monitoring of steam boiler operation in power stations. The framework is based on the use of historical process data as a reference for real-time operation. The actual boiler efficiency is monitored together with its expected efficiency, which is an estimate of the highest historical efficiency in the corresponding process state, based on a data-driven model. In the presented approach, the process state is defined on the basis of variables that have the strongest correlation with boiler efficiency according to information-theoretic variable ranking. Boiler performance is monitored using a statistical process control chart for the difference between the expected and actual efficiencies. The framework was tested using data from a circulating fluidised bed boiler and from a corner-fired boiler. The results revealed that the strongest correlations between process variables and boiler efficiency are substantially consistent in both cases. Moreover, the framework provides a novel measure for boiler performance enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AD was induced by aluminum chloride (17 mg/kg, p.o. for 6 weeks) and confirmed by Morris water maze and Y-maze behavioral tests. Biochemical and histological analyses of the hippocampus were also performed. Aluminum-treated rats showed behavioral, biochemical, and histological changes similar to those associated with AD. ND improved learning and memory and reversed histological alterations. At the molecular levels, ND mitigated the increase of hippocampal beta-amyloid (A beta(42)) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) together with down-regulation of phosphorylated tau protein. It also modulated the excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter level. Furthermore, ND boosted the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondrial transcription factor-A (TFAM), suppressed the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and curbed oxidative stress by hampering of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

Results Among 681 men, 86 men (12.6%) had low testosterone levels, 143 (32.7%) had a positive biopsy, and 99 (14.5%) had high-grade prostate cancer. The mean age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, body mass index (BMI), number of abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, and diabetes mellitus (DM) history were significantly different between the low and normal level testosterone groups. A low testosterone level was significantly associated with a higher risk of detection of overall prostate cancer than a normal testosterone level in univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.545, P = 0.001), but not in multivariate analysis adjusting for parameters such as age, PSA, prostate volume, BMI, abnormal DRE findings and DM (OR 1.583, P = 0.277).

A total of four focus group discussions, 16 in-depth interviews, four informal conversations, and observations were equally divided between both study sites. Results: Discrepancies between what adolescents and young adults know and what they do quickly became evident. Ambivalent and contradictory practices concerning contraceptive use was the result. As well, young people had numerous interpretations of risk-taking when not using contraceptives. These inconsistencies are influenced by social and medical barriers such as restricted dialogue on sexuality among adolescents and young adults and their parents and peers. Additionally, ideas about indigenous contraceptives, notions of masculinity and femininity, misconceptions and fear of the side effects of contraceptives, make people of all ages wary of modern birth control. Other barriers include imposed contraceptive choice - meaning no choice, overly technical medical language used at clinics and the absence of healthcare workers more attuned to the needs of adolescents and young adults. Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults have numerous - often erroneous - opinions about contraception, leading to inconsistent use as well as vague perceptions of risk-taking.

In Experiment 1 high (n = 26) versus low (n = 25) socially anxious single women between 18 and 30 years had a video (\"Slcype\") conversation with an attractive male confederate, while seeing themselves and the confederate on-screen. The conversation was divided in four phases: (I) warm-up, (II) positive (confederate was friendly to the participant), (III) critical (confederate was critical to the participant), and (IV) active (participant was instructed to ask questions to the confederate). Participant's SFA was measured by eye-tracked gaze duration at their own image relative to the confederates' video image and other places at the computer screen. Results show that high socially anxious participants were more self-focused in the critical phase, but less self-focused in the active phase than low socially anxious participants. In Experiment 2 women diagnosed with SAD (n = 32) and controls (n = 30) between 18 and 30 years conducted the same experiment. Compared to controls participants with SAD showed increased SFA across all four phases of the conversation, and SFA predicted increased self-rated anxiety during the conversation. In conclusion, in subclinical social anxiety SFA is high only when the interaction partner is critical, whereas instructions to ask questions to the confederate reduces subclinical socially anxious' SFA, while clinical SAD is characterized by heightened self-focused attention throughout the interaction. Results support theories that social anxiety disorder is maintained by SFA, and imply that interventions that lower SFA may help prevent and treat social anxiety disorder, but that SFA can also be adaptive in certain types of interaction, such as when receiving compliments.

The present study investigates if individuals with polysubstance use disorder who achieve at least one year of abstinence show greater improvements in satisfaction with life, executive functions, and psychological distress, compared to relapsers and controls. The prospective recovery from polysubstance use disorder assessed with broad output indicators remains understudied. A better understanding of the pattern of recovery of the chosen output indicators could shed light on the recovery process for this group of patients. Material and methods: We investigated changes in satisfaction with life, executive functions and psychological distress over a period of 12 months in patients who remained abstinent and in those who relapsed. Subjects with polysubstance use disorder (N = 115) were recruited from outpatient and residential treatment facilities; healthy controls (N = 34) were recruited by posters exhibited at social welfare and GP offices. Executive functions were assessed by the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult self-report version (BRIEF A), psychological distress by the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R), and satisfaction with life by the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Substance use was assessed by self-reports on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT). Participants were categorized as \"relapsers\" if they had AUDIT score >= 8 or DUDIT score >= 2 for women and >= 6 for men. Results: Results indicated that the abstinent group had the greatest improvement on all the indicators compared with relapsers and controls. Participants who successfully quit substance use for one year showed improved satisfaction with life, executive functions, and psychological distress compared to participants who relapsed and controls. Conclusions: Our study provides support for the view that there is a clinically and statistically significant recovery of satisfaction with life, executive functions, and psychological distress for SUD patients following one-year of abstinence. This knowledge highlights the importance of time and continued abstinence. Our findings suggest that a gradual and careful step-up of learning requirement should be adopted, and SUD treatment should initially focus on stabilizing the patient and achieving abstinence, while interventions for co-morbid problems and more cognitively demanding treatment components are more likely to succeed later in the treatment sequence.

Amyloid plaques are composed of beta-amyloid peptides (A beta), while NFTs contain hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Patients with familial AD who have mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have either increased production of A beta or generate more aggregation-prone forms of A beta. The findings of familial AD mutations in the APP gene suggest that A beta plays a central role in the pathophysiology of AD. A beta 42, composed of 42 amino acid residues, aggregates readily and is considered to form amyloid plaque. However, the processes of plaque formation are still not well known. It is generally thought that A beta is secreted into the extracellular space and aggregates to form amyloid plaques. A beta as extracellular aggregates and amyloid plaques are thought to be toxic to the surrounding neurons. The intraneuronal accumulation of A beta has more recently been demonstrated and is reported to be involved in synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and the formation of amyloid plaques in AD.

In the conventional digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) designs, one single band of operation is assigned to the DCO. The following paper presents a new approach in the design of DCOs, which works in dual-band and wide-band modes with a control unit. In dual-band mode, the DCO works in two different ranges of frequencies simultaneously via digital control bits. The wide-band DCO (WBDCO) works in one wider range of frequencies consecutively. It seems that in the wide-band DCO, the gap width for the dual-band DCO (DBDCO) is zero. The previously mentioned designs allow the designer to have standard frequencies with the help of direct or multiplied frequencies. So, we can have a trade-off between power and performance. This means that we can have low power consumption in low-frequency applications and vice versa. The proposed designs are based on using digitally controlled capacitors, current starving gates and Schmitt triggers in critical points of the DCO loop, while preserving coarse and fine tunings. The non-delay linearity factors are clearly investigated and resolved with the use of a new combined control unit.

Rat HIT-4 cDNA exhibits strong homology to human ZNF597 (57% amino acid identity and 72% homology) and identity to rat ZNF597 at the carboxyl region.

Traditional operational and environmental efficiency measures do not fully consider the influence of market competition and environmental regulations and, thus, are not sufficient for the thermal power industry to evaluate its operational performance with respect to specific marketing goals (operational effectiveness) and its environmental performance with respect to specific emissions reduction targets (environmental effectiveness). As a complement to an operational efficiency measure, an operational effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to increase its electricity generation through the improvement of operational efficiency, but it also reflects the system's capability to adjust its electricity generation activities to match electricity demand. In addition, as a complement to an environmental efficiency measure, an environmental effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to decrease its pollutant emissions through the improvement of environmental efficiency, but it also reflects the system's capability to adjust its emissions abatement activities to fulfill environmental regulations. Furthermore, an environmental effectiveness measure helps the government regulator to verify the rationality of its emissions reduction targets assigned to the thermal power industry. Several newly developed effectiveness measurements based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) were utilized in this study to evaluate the operational and environmental performance of the thermal power industry in China during 2006-2013. Both efficiency and effectiveness were evaluated from the three perspectives of operational, environmental, and joint adjustments to each electricity production system. The operational and environmental performance changes over time were also captured through an effectiveness measure based on the global Malmquist productivity index.

More recently, functional MRI augmented with a reinforcement learning computational model revealed that impaired decision-making in suicide attempters is paralleled by disrupted expected value (expected reward) signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Behavioral studies have linked increased delay discounting to low-lethality/poorly planned attempts, multiple attempts, and the co-occurrence of attempted suicide and addiction.

In an as-treated analysis individuals were compared according to the counseling components actually received, disregarding randomization. In an instrumental variable analysis the effect of the intervention among those who would always be treated as assigned was estimated. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between tobacco cessation outcomes (seven-day abstinence, three-month abstinence, half-reduction, quit attempts) and the defined exposure to the intervention. Protocol adherence in the intervention group was 73.4%. The per-protocol analysis closely replicated the results of the intention-to-treat analysis, showing a statistically significant effect of the brief counseling on the reduction in tobacco consumption OR -1.81, 95% CI [1.06, 3.07], but no significant effect for other outcomes. In the as-treated analysis, receiving more counseling components compared with no tobacco counseling increased the likelihood of half-reduction. The instrumental variable yielded biased results. We conclude that despite application problems, conducting per-protocol, as-treated and instrumental variable analyses in randomized trials where experimental conditions are not strictly standardized strengthens and puts in context the inference based on intention-to-treat analysis.

The present theoretical predictions are found in agreement with the existing experimental results, which shows that the moisture absorption related damage develops rapidly and reaches a plateau within 20 days, resulting in a sharp decrease of elastic modulus of the composite at the early ageing stage, whereas the evolution of deterioration associated with hydrolysis reaction is at a much slower rate.

Over the past decades modifiable risk factors of CHD have been identified, including smoking and diet. These factors when altered can have a significant impact on an individuals' risk of developing CHD, their overall health and quality of life. There is strong evidence suggesting that dietary intake of plant foods rich in fibre and polyphenolic compounds, effectively lowers the risk of developing CHD. However, the efficacy of these foods often appears to be greater than the sum of their recognised biologically active parts. Here we discuss the hypothesis that beneficial metabolic and vascular effects of dietary fibre and plant polyphenols are due to an up regulation of the colon-systemic metabolic axis by these compounds. Fibres and many polyphenols are converted into biologically active compounds by the colonic microbiota. This microbiota imparts great metabolic versatility and dynamism, with many of their reductive or hydrolytic activities appearing complementary to oxidative or conjugative human metabolism. Understanding these microbial activities is central to determining the role of different dietary components in preventing or beneficially impacting on the impaired lipid metabolism and vascular dysfunction that typifies CHD and type 11 diabetes.

The present study tested whether FSB use explained the relation of anxiety symptom severity with cannabis quantity and related problems among 77 adults with CUD and comorbid anxiety disorders seeking outpatient CUD treatment. Results indicated that FSB frequency was significantly related to anxiety symptom severity and cannabis problem severity, but not cannabis quantity.

The use of data ferries can significantly reduce energy consumption at sensor nodes and increase network lifetime. However, it usually incurs long data delivery latency as the data ferry needs to travel through the network to collect data, during which some delay-sensitive data may become obsolete. Therefore, it is important to optimize the trajectory of the data ferry with data delivery latency bound for this approach to be effective in practice. To address this problem, we formally define the time-constrained data harvesting problem, which seeks an optimal data harvesting path in a network to collect as much data as possible within a time duration. We then investigate the formulated data harvesting problem in the generic m-dimensional context, of which the cases of m = 1, 2, 3 are particularly pertinent. We first characterize the performance bound given by the optimal data harvesting algorithm and show that the optimal algorithm significantly outperforms the random algorithm, especially when network scales. However, we mathematically prove that finding the optimal data harvesting path is NP-hard. We therefore devise an approximation algorithm and mathematically prove the output being a constant-factor approximation of the optimal solution.

Results: There were 1432 respondents who identified as gay, lesbian, or homosexual, and 67,746 who identified as heterosexual. The percentage of participants who reported being married/ legally partnered was 54.06% for heterosexual women, 52.93% for heterosexual men, 38.83% for lesbians, and 23.56% for gay men. Legally partnered/married gay and lesbian respondents were more likely to have health insurance and use healthcare than their counterparts not in such partnerships; few trends were statistically significant. Gay men in legally recognized partnerships were more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report continuous health insurance coverage, a usual medical care source, and at least one provider visit within the past 12 months. We found statistically significant poorer health status outcomes among lesbians in legally recognized partnerships compared to married heterosexual women. Conclusions: Lesbians in legally recognized partnerships did not fare as well as married heterosexual women. Gay men in legally recognized partnerships fared better than married heterosexual men on some measures. CHIS questionnaire structures limited our sample and analyses.

In this study, we investigate the independent and cooperative interactions of testosterone and diet-induced obesity on metabolic, inflammatory, and neural health indices in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Methods: Male C57B6/J mice were maintained on normal or high-fat diet under varying testosterone conditions for a four-month treatment period, after which metabolic indices were measured and RNA isolated from cerebral cortex and sciatic nerve. Cortices were used to generate mixed glial cultures, upon which embryonic cerebrocortical neurons were co-cultured for assessment of neuron survival and neurite outgrowth. Peripheral nerve damage was determined using paw-withdrawal assay, myelin sheath protein expression levels, and Na+, K+-ATPase activity levels. Results: Our results demonstrate that detrimental effects on both metabolic (blood glucose, insulin sensitivity) and proinflammatory (cytokine expression) responses caused by diet-induced obesity are exacerbated by testosterone depletion. Mixed glial cultures generated from obese mice retain elevated cytokine expression, although low testosterone effects do not persist ex vivo. Primary neurons co-cultured with glial cultures generated from high-fat fed animals exhibit reduced survival and poorer neurite outgrowth. In addition, low testosterone and diet-induced obesity combine to increase inflammation and evidence of nerve damage in the peripheral nervous system. Conclusions: Testosterone and diet-induced obesity independently and cooperatively regulate neuroinflammation in central and peripheral nervous systems, which may contribute to observed impairments in neural health.

Here, we investigated the changes in intestinal microbiota and Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in HTG-related ANP (HANP) in rats. Rats fed a high-fat diet to induce HTG and ANP was induced by retrograde injection of 3.5% sodium taurocholate into biliopancreatic duct. Rats were sacrificed at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Pancreatic and ileal injuries were evaluated by histological scores. Intestinal barrier function was assessed by plasma diamine oxidase activity and D-lactate level. Systemic and intestinal inflammation was evaluated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-17A expression. 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing was used to investigate changes in intestinal microbiota diversity and structure. AMPs (alpha-defensin5 and lysozyme) expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunofluorescence. The results showed that compared with those of normal-lipid ANP (NANP) groups, the HANP groups had more severe histopathological injuries in pancreas and distal ileum, aggravated intestinal barrier dysfunction and increased TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-17A expression in plasma and distal ileum. Principal component analysis showed structural segregation between the HANP and NANP group. alpha-Diversity estimators in the HANP group revealed decreased microbiota diversity compared with that in NANP group. Taxonomic analysis showed dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota structure. In the HANP group, at phyla level, Candidatus_Saccharibacteria and Tenericutes decreased significantly, whereas Actinobacteria increased. At genus level, Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Parasutterella increased significantly, while Alloprevotella, Anaerotruncus, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminiclostridium_5, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 decreased.

Methods In addition to a 6-week didactic course on DBT offered to all residents (n = 62), 25 elected to enroll in a year-long DBT clinical training curriculum over the course of a 5-year period. The DBT clinical training consisted of 15 h of additional didactics, ongoing conduct of individual therapy and group DBT skills training, videotaping of individual therapy sessions, and weekly supervision meetings utilizing videotape to provide feedback. Residents participating in the clinical training program videotaped baseline and later sessions, which were rated for DBT adherence.

Although pain management is important for good postoperative outcomes, it can be a challenging task for families, and children's pain is often under-managed. Design. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore parents' experiences of managing their child's postoperative pain at home. Methods. Participants were parents of 10 typically developing 5- and 6-year olds, who underwent (adeno) tonsillectomy, and experienced no complications leading to hospitalisation in the postoperative period. One-on-one interviews were conducted with parents within three months of their child's surgery.

The scale-dependent variability in soil properties causes challenges for the characterization and mapping of soils. With the advent of technologies, proximal sensors such as gamma radiometrics can characterize soil spatial variability and the digital mapping of soil properties. In this study we aim to characterize scale-dependent variability of proximal gamma radiometrics and its complex relationship with soil properties at different scales using wavelet transform and wavelet coherency. We measured gamma radio metrics (gamma-ray potassium (K-40), uranium (U-238), thorium (Th-232) and Total Count (gamma-TC)) using a hand-held device in the field every 25 m along a 3.0 km transect. At each point we measured elevation (m) and land use and collected soil samples to determine key soil properties (electrical conductivity EC1:5, pH (CaCl2), soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable potassium (exch. K), and Colwell P). Wavelet spectra identified significant (P < 0.05) variations at different scales and locations for both gamma-ray and soil properties. There were significant localized variations with changes in elevation and land use also important. In most cases a 'global' Pearson correlation between the gamma-ray and soil properties was not significant. In contrast, wavelet coherency provided a more powerful scale-and location-specific relationship between gamma-ray, elevation and land use with selected soil properties. For example, a strong correlation (18% of the area was significant) was detected between land use and soil EC1:5 at all scales (800 m) there was significant positive correlations between gamma-TC and SOC (36% by area). At medium scales (similar to 400 m) there was significant and positive correlations between K-40 and CEC (23% by area), but only along the first half of the transect which was underlain with Bushy Creek Granodiorite. These findings provide an improved understanding of the spatial variability of gamma-ray-soil relationships. The approach used shows the scope and significant potential to use wavelet analysis of gamma-soil property relationships that are scale-specific and would be useful for digital soil mapping. Moreover, scale-specific spatial information of soil properties aids understanding of soil formation processes and it illustrates an approach to improve future soil sampling strategies.

Protein kinase C was also required for zymosan-induced cytokine generation in neutrophils. In macrophages, protein kinase C deficiency prevented fungi-induced reactive oxygen species generation but had no effect on activation of TGF--activated kinase-1, an effector of Card9, or nuclear factor B activation, nor did it affect phagolysosomal maturation, autophagy, or intracellular C. albicans killing. In vivo, protein kinase C-deficient mice were highly susceptible to C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus infection, which was partially rescued with adoptively transferred wild-type neutrophils.

The most important issue to be addressed on this type of engines is the compliance with stringent rules on pollutant emissions, which depends on combustion patterns and the quality of the scavenging process. The latter is generally hindered by the symmetry of ports timings, but this handicap can be canceled by adopting a patented rotary valve, controlling the flow through a set of auxiliary transfer ports, and using a piston pump for delivering air to the power cylinder and enhancing the balance of the crankshaft. The paper reviews the design of a virtual engine, rated at 35 kW at 5600 rpm, and developed according to the above mentioned concepts. Design has been driven by CFD simulation, using, whenever possible, experimentally calibrated numerical models, or experimental information derived from similar projects. Particular care has been devoted to characterize the scavenging process and the flow patterns within the cylinder and through the ports, analyzing the influence of the rotary induction valve. Engine performance parameters have been predicted by using a well-established commercial software (GT-Power, by Gamma Technologies), while CFD-3D analyses have been carried out by means of a customized version of the KIVA-3V code. The whole study is conceived as the basis for the construction of a physical prototype. The power target has been virtually achieved with a very light and compact engine (estimated weight without the close-coupled electric motor: 35 kg). A three-way catalyst allows the engine to comply with the most stringent emission regulations, without relevant penalizations on fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the engine can work with lean mixtures, achieving a minimum specific fuel consumption comparable to a current automotive Diesel engine (223 g/kWh).

Those calculations assumed that intercourse and ovulation are independent. Subsequent research has shown that this assumption is not valid. We provide here an update of previous benchmark estimates. Study design: We reanalyze earlier data from two North Carolina studies that collected daily urine samples and recorded daily intercourse for multiple menstrual cycles. One study comprised 68 sexually active women with either an intrauterine device or tubal ligation. The second was of 221 women who planned to become pregnant and had discontinued use of any birth control at enrollment. Participants had no known fertility problems. New statistical analyses were based on Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian methods. Results: The probability that a single act of intercourse occurs within a woman's fertile window is 25%, compared with 20% in previous calculations. The probability of pregnancy with intercourse on a given menstrual cycle day is correspondingly higher than previously estimated, with the largest increases occurring on menstrual days 12-22. These increases are, however, fairly small (for example, the peak chance of conception on menstrual day 13 increased from 8.6% to 9.7%). Conclusions: Previous benchmark rates of pregnancy with one act of intercourse were moderately underestimated due to a mistaken assumption about the independence of intercourse and ovulation.

Prior literature suggests elected officials promulgate punitive, racially disparate criminal justice policies due to partisanship and racial fears, but scholarship has yet to explain how and why elected officials address racial problems in criminal processing. This article introduces the framework of racial disparity reform policymaking. A racial disparity reform is a policy that seeks to reduce distinctions in criminal justice institutions' treatment of racial groups. Elected officials pursue these policies due to ideological beliefs in civil rights ideals and political interests in appearing to solve social problems. Using an original database of policy enactments, this article first presents the distribution and types of reform measures adopted by elected officials in all 50 states between 1998 and 2011. It then examines social and political explanations for when state legislatures and executives adopt racial disparity reforms. Policy enactment is predicted by worsening problems of racial disproportion in criminal processing, Democratic control of elected branches, and the absence of judicial efforts to improve racial fairness within a state's criminal justice system. Similar dynamics encourage the development of different measures types within policies. Such ideological and problem-solving explanations for racial disparity reform show a potential for elected officials to forge more racially just criminal justice practices.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 34217, "input": "The controller area network with flexible data rate (CAN-FD) is attracting attention as the next generation of in-vehicle network technology.

Methods: A community reference group (CBPR) was established and bi-lingual community research associates were used to conduct focus groups comprised of Latino caregivers. Transcripts were analyzed for thematic content using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Results indicated significant gaps in parental knowledge regarding caries etiology and prevention, with cultural underlays. Most parents believed the etiology of caries was related to the child's ingestion of certain foods containing high amounts of carbohydrates. Fewer parents believed either genetics/biological inheritance or bacteria was the primary causative factor. Fatalism negatively impacted preventive practices, and a clear separation existed concerning the perceived responsibilities of mothers and fathers to provide for the oral needs of their children. Females were more likely to report they were primarily responsible for brushing their children's teeth, overseeing the child's diet and seeking dental care for the child. Fathers believed they were primarily responsible for providing the means to pay for professional care.

Methods: High-resolution metabolomics was performed on urine samples from CS-respondent (n = 15) and CS-nonrespondent (n = 15) children to determine possible urine biomarkers related to CS resistance. The metabolic phenotypes of CS responders and CS nonresponders were analyzed using bioinformatics including Manhattan plot with false- discovery rate, hierarchical cluster analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes, and Mummichog pathway analysis. Results: The 2-way hierarchical cluster analysis study determined 30 metabolites showing significantly different levels between CS responders and CS nonresponders. The important metabolites annotated were 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid (126.05 m/z, RT: 106, [M1H](+)), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl(ethylene) glycol (185.05 m/z, RT: 155, [M1H](+)), 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (198.07 m/z, RT: 446, [M1H](+)), gamma-glutamylcysteine (236.06 m/z, RT: 528, [M1S(34)+H](+)), Cys-Gly, (253.06 m/z, RT: 528, [M-NH3+H](+)), and reduced Flavin mononucleotide (517.0794 m/z, RT: 533, [M+NaCl](+)). Tyrosine metabolism, degradation of aromatic compounds, and glutathione metabolism are suggested to be significant pathways relating to CS resistance. Conclusions: High-resolution metabolomics is a promising approach in asthma research. Five candidate markers were identified to be related to CS-resistant children with severe asthma. These compounds, upon validation, may contribute further in the understanding of CS resistance among children with severe asthma through the use ofurine.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 2117, "input": "After critically reviewing the divisions of imitation as proposed by Dryden and Genette, among others, the author discusses the evolution of this concept, from its origins to its latest development in modern England.

In the post-genomic era, a major challenge is to identify antigenic regions or epitopes that can stimulate different arms of the immune system. In the past two decades, numerous methods and databases have been developed for designing vaccine or immunotherapy against various pathogen-causing diseases. This review describes various computational resources important for designing subunit vaccines or epitope-based immunotherapy. First, different immunological databases are described that maintain epitopes, antigens and vaccine targets. This is followed by in silico tools used for predicting linear and conformational B-cell epitopes required for activating humoral immunity. Finally, information on T-cell epitope prediction methods is provided that includes indirect methods like prediction of Major Histocompatibility Complex and transporter-associated protein binders. Different studies for validating the predicted epitopes are also examined critically. This review enlists novel in silico resources and tools available for predicting humoral and cell-mediated immune potential. These predicted epitopes could be used for designing epitope-based vaccines or immunotherapy as they may activate the adaptive immunity.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect on the performance of qRT-PCR with different sampling materials, conditions of storage of the OF, the need for centrifuging OF, as well as to compare RNA extraction methods and PCR mixes. For the assays, pen-based oral fluids were used, which were pooled and spiked in a serial dilution (up to genotype 10(circle) TCID50/mL) of type 1 PRRSV isolate 3267.

Although acute loss of hypothalamic neurons that produce appetite-stimulating neuropeptide Y (Npy) and agouti-related peptide (Agrp) in adult mice or in mice homozygous for the anorexia (anx) mutation causes aphagia, our understanding of the factors that help maintain appetite regulatory circuitry is limited. Here we identify a mutation (C19T) that converts an arginine to a tryptophan (R7W) in the TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase 3 (Tyro3) gene, which resides within the anx critical interval, as contributing to the severity of anx phenotypes. Our observation that, like Tyro3(-/-) mice, anx/ anx mice exhibit abnormal secondary platelet aggregation suggested that the C19T Tyro3 variant might have functional consequences. Tyro3 is expressed in the hypothalamus and other brain regions affected by the anx mutation, and its mRNA localization appeared abnormal in anx/ anx brains by postnatal day 19 (P19). The presence of wild-type Tyro3 transgenes, but not an R7W-Tyro3 transgene, doubled the weight and lifespans of anx/anx mice and near-normal numbers of hypothalamic Npy-expressing neurons were present in Tyro3-transgenic anx/anx mice at P19. Although no differences in R7W-Tyro3 signal sequence function or protein localization were discernible in vitro, distribution of R7W-Tyro3 protein differed from that of Tyro3 protein in the cerebellum of transgenic wild-type mice. Thus, R7W-Tyro3 protein localization deficits are only detectable in vivo. Further analyses revealed that the C19T Tyro3 mutation is present in a few other mouse strains, and hence is not the causative anx mutation, but rather an anx modifier. Our work shows that Tyro3 has prosurvival roles in the appetite regulatory circuitry and could also provide useful insights towards the development of interventions targeting detrimental weight loss.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 28093, "input": "Previous time series or panel studies of asthmatics have reported respiratory health effects following short-term exposure to ozone (O-3).

We applied mixed models controlling for various possible confounders to investigate the daily associations between O-3 exposure - derived from weekly personal and fixed school site measurements calibrated using daily values of the fixed monitoring site nearest to the child's school location -and PEF, presence of any symptom, cough and stuffy nose, as well as absenteeism. We tested the robustness of our findings to varying modeling assumptions and confounders and investigated effect modification patterns by medication use, time spent outdoors and prevalence of asthma. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in O-3 personal exposure was associated with increased odds of any symptom (odds ratio (OR): 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98, 1.44), largely attributed to the increase in the odds of stuffy nose (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.51). PEF and absenteeism were not related to O-3 exposure. Our results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. Effects were modified by medication use as presence of symptoms but also decreases in PEF were mainly reported among non-users, while our effect estimates were not driven by the asthmatic subgroup of children.

From understanding signals emanating out of deep space probes to signals in protein interactions for systems biology, domain specific innovations are needed.

In this domain, the design of noise filtering scheme has to consider a time varying and nonlinear system dynamics at play. The accuracy of conventional particle filter formulation suffers due to deviations from modeled system dynamics. An evolutionary particle filter can overcome this problem by evolving multiple system models through few support points per particle. However, this variant has even higher time complexity for real-time execution. As a result, measurement update gets deferred and the estimation accuracy is compromised. By running these filter algorithms on multiple processors, the execution time can be reduced, to allow frequent measurement updates.

In each of these strategies, the therapeutic goal is to re-ignite T-cell immunity, in order to eradicate tumors. In transplantation, there is also great interest in targeting T-cell co-signaling, but with the opposite goal: in this field, we seek the Yin to cancer immunotherapy's Yang, and focus on manipulating T-cell co-signaling to induce tolerance rather than activation. In this review, we discuss the major T-cell signaling pathways that are being investigated for tolerance induction, detailing preclinical studies and the path to the clinic for many of these molecules. These include blockade of co-stimulation pathways and agonism of coinhibitory pathways, in order to achieve the delicate state of balance that is transplant tolerance: a state which guarantees lifelong transplant acceptance without ongoing immunosuppression, and with preservation of protective immune responses. In the context of the clinical translation of immune tolerance strategies, we discuss the significant challenge that is embodied by the fact that targeted pathway modulators may have opposing effects on tolerance based on their impact on effector vs regulatory T-cell biology.

The resulting DNA-AgNC/GO would show quite reduced fluorescence signal because the fluorescence from DNA-AgNCs is quenched by GO. In the presence of DNase I, however, it degrades the DNA strand within DNA/RNA hybrid duplex probe employed in this study, consequently releasing RNA which is complementary to the extension DNA. The released free RNA then extracts DNA-AgNC from GO by hybridizing with the extension DNA bound to GO. This process would restore the quenched fluorescence, emitting highly enhanced fluorescence signal. By employing this assay principle, DNase I activity was reliably identified with a detection limit of 0.10 U/ml which is lower than those from previous fluorescence-based methods.

Northern blot analysis revealed that VEGF-B mRNA was not expressed either in normal urothelium or in bladder cancer and detected three VEGF-A transcripts of 5.2, 4.5 and 1.7 kb in length, respectively. The VEGF-A transcript levels were greater in cancer tissues than in normal urothelium. They were significantly higher in pT2-T4 than in pTa and pT1 urothelial tumors and thus, were correlated to the pathologic stage. Contrary to the 4.5 kb transcript, elevated expression of the 5.2 and 1.7 kb transcripts was correlated with the histologic grade and the presence of carcinoma in situ. Patients with higher VEGF-A mRNA levels had a significantly shorter survival without progression compared to those with lower levels. Three VEGF-A splice variants were detected by Southern blotting namely, VEGF 121, 165 and 189. The expression intensity of each isoform was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 20 new fresh frozen recent tumors. VEGF 121 and VEGF 165 were expressed at the similar level. On the contrary, they were significantly more expressed than VEGF189 (p<0.05). The three isoforms were higher expressed in pT2 bladder cancers than in pTa tumors (p<0.05). There was only a significant correlation between the increased expression level of VEGF121 and 165 and the histological grade of the lesion (p<0.05). To conclude, VEGF-A mRNA level is a potential prognostic indicator of progression in bladder cancer as well as the expression level of the different VEGF-A splice variants.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 22301, "input": "Mental health-related stigma affects people with mental disorders and their families. We aimed to investigate the experience of stigma among relatives of patients with schizophrenia in Belarus and formulate recommendations for anti-stigma interventions. We conducted and thematically analysed 20 interviews with relatives of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Experience of discrimination, strategies to cope with it, and requests for interventions were examined. A number of themes related to the experience of stigma in the public life of relatives of people with schizophrenia were elicited in relation to: (1) mental health care (difficulties in contacting mental health professionals; in getting appropriate information; lack of alternatives to hospital treatment; absence of appropriate long-term care services); (2) employment of people living with schizophrenia and (3) contact with the police. Analysis of the strategies used to overcome difficulties revealed resignation and passive acceptance, self-reliance, and emotional containment during crises. Despite the passivity and scepticism in expressing needs, participants suggested a number of interventions that could reduce the burden of stigma. With respect to the public domain of life, substantial stigma and discrimination perceived by families of people living with schizophrenia in Belarus is associated with structural issues of the country's mental health care system. To reduce the stigma-related burden, action must be taken to: (1) educate and support families and (2) deal with structural issues, by reorganising mental health services to better meet the needs of the families of people diagnosed with schizophrenia, and by including them in decision making at all levels.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 8935, "input": "Background: Youths in universities are at high risk of STIs and SRH problems in Ethiopia. However, students did not perceive themselves at risk of STI/HIV infection though reports showed they were sexually active, had multiple sexual partners and reported symptoms of STIs. Having recognized the threat posed by SRH problems, this study aimed to assess the SRH experiences, knowledge, and problems among university students at Ambo University in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ambo University main campus from January to February 2015 using mixed approach of quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interview) methods. Proportionate stratified sampling technique was used to select 400 survey respondents and purposive sampling was employed to identify 10 in-depth interviewees. The quantitative data was coded, entered to SPSS and descriptively analyzed, while the qualitative data was categorically organized, repeatedly reviewed and thematically analyzed. Results: Mean age during first sex of 17.29 +/- SD 2.21 and mean number of past 12 months regular sexual partners of 1.36 +/- SD 0.505 were recorded. Only 21.1% of survey respondents perceived themselves to be at risk of HIV. Almost all survey respondents ever heard of STIs (94.5%) and HIV/AIDS (98%), and 89.4% knew modern contraceptives such as pills (64.8%) and condoms (56.8%). Despite awareness of STIs including HIV/AIDS, more than one fifth (22.8%) had any of the STIs in the past one year. Although the quantitative data showed unwanted pregnancy (5%) and abortion (2.5%) existed in the campus minimally, high rates of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion were reported in the qualitative data. Conclusions: SRH/STIs were problems among students of the university. Although students knew about STIs, the STI infection rate in the past year was quite high, and was almost as high as the percentage of students who reported sexual activity in the past year. Though reported by a minority of students, unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion may also be a problem.

Methods It is a cross-sectional study about 180 patients with known and treated adrenal insufficiency. The patients responded to a 14-item questionnaire concerning their knowledge about the disease and fasting during the last month of Ramadan. Results There were 132 women and 48 men. The mean age was 47.6 +/- 15.0 years (14-79). One hundred and thirty eight patients (76.7 %) were advised by their physician not to fast. Ninety-one patients (50.5 %) tried to fast. Complications occurred in 61 cases (67.0 %): asthenia in 88.5% of cases, intense thirst in 32.8 %, symptoms of dehydration in 49.2% and symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 18 %.

The samples, constituted by anatase nanocrystals but, mainly, by amorphous titania, are studied by H-1-MAS NMR, FT-IR and HRTEM. The results indicate that hydrated excess proton species, generated by solvation of bridging hydroxyls protons of highly defective anatase and/or amorphous titania chains, favor the chains bonding to anatase nanoparticles and/or their condensation at the nanoparticles surface. The chains' bonding facilitates the anatase particles aggregation producing oriented self-assemblings.

Areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and surrounding medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) within the DMN have been implicated specifically in regulating autonomic and neuroendocrine processes that relate to systemic inflammation via bidirectional signaling mechanisms. However, it is still unclear whether indicators of inflammation relate directly to coherent resting state activity of the ACC, mPFC, or other areas within the DMN. Accordingly, we tested whether plasma interleukin (IL)-6, an indicator of systemic inflammation, covaried with resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN among 98 adults aged 30-54 (39% male; 81% Caucasian). Independent component analyses were applied to resting state fMRI data to generate DMN connectivity maps. Voxel-wise regression analyses were then used to test for associations between IL -6 and DMN connectivity across individuals, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and fMRI signal motion. Within the DMN, IL -6 covaried positively with connectivity of the sub-genual ACC and negatively with a region of the dorsal medial PFC at corrected statistical thresholds. These novel findings offer evidence for a unique association between a marker of systemic inflammation (IL -6) and ACC and mPFC functional connectivity within the DMN, a network that may be important for linking aspects of immune function to psychological and behavioral states in health and disease.

Log-logistic models were used to describe the responses of temperatures, weed density, time required for hand weeding, weed dry biomass at harvest, and carrot yield to the band-steaming application. Based on the experimental data, an economic margin was evaluated to find the optimum application dose. Overall responses were influenced by steam dose. The results showed that a maximum temperature of 63 degrees C at a 25 mm depth was observed with a steam dose of 2.78 kg m(-2). With a 2.78 kg m(-2) dose, the operative time was approximately 14 h ha(-1) and total fuel consumption was 768 kg ha-1. An estimated mean steam dose of 2.3 kg m(-2) could be able to provide similar yield and hand weeding times responses to the highest steam dose applied, thus reducing both the operative time and fuel consumption of the machine.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from a national administrative claims database including commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients. We identified all ED visits for anaphylaxis and calculated rates as number of anaphylaxis-related ED visits per 100,000 enrollees. Rates were compared over time and by age and trigger. RESULTS: During the 10-year time period, 56,212 ED visits for anaphylaxis were identified. The median (interquartile range) age was 36 (17-52 years) years, and 58% were female. Most cases (57%) were due to unspecified triggers, 27% were associated with food, 12% were medication related, and 4% were due to insect venom.

We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for head injury associated with helmet use, with non-head injuries representing controls. For bicycling, we validated ORs against published estimates. ORs were calculated for other sports and we examined factors associated with helmet reporting. Results: Of 105,614 bicycling injury narratives reviewed, 14.1% contained sufficient helmet information for use in the case-control study. The adjusted ORs for head injuries associated with helmet-wearing were smaller than, but directionally consistent, with previously published estimates (e.g., 1999 Cochrane Review). ORs illustrated a protective effect of helmets for other sports as well (less than 1). Conclusions: This exploratory analysis illustrates the potential utility of relatively simple text-search algorithms to identify additional variables in surveillance data. Limitations of this study include possible selection bias and the inability to identify individuals with multiple injuries.

Our results are broadly consistent with Bartlett's (1932) informal observations: Serial reproduction produces greater forgetting of the original material than does repeated reproduction and also leads to greater distortion relative to the proportion of correct material recalled.

The puise-height integrals and the relative time are all stored on capacitors and are either reset, after a user controlled time, or sequentially read out if acquisition of the event is desired. Each of the three pulse-height sub-channels consists of a gated integrator with eight programmable charging rates and an externally programmable gate generator that defines the start (with four time ranges) and width (with four time ranges) of the gate relative to an external discriminator signal. The chip supports three triggering modes, two time ranges, two power modes, and produces four sparsified analog pulse trains (three for the integrators and another for the time) with synchronized addresses for off-chip digitization with a pipelined ADC. The eight-channel prototype chip occupies an area of 2.8 mm x 5.7 mm, dissipates 60 mW (low-power mode), and was fabricated in the AMI 0.5-mu m process (C5N). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The inverted graph allows backtracing to justify analog outputs with analog input sinusoids. Mixed-signal circuits can be tested using this approach, and we present test generation results for two mixed-signal circuits and four analog circuits, one being a multiple-input, multiple-output circuit. This analog backtrace method can generate tests for second-order analog circuits and certain non-linear circuits. These cannot be handled by existing methods, which lack a fault model and a backtrace method. Our proposed method also defines the necessary tolerances on circuit structural components, in order to keep the output circuit signal within the envelope specified by the designer. This avoids the problem of overspecifying analog circuit component tolerances, and reduces cost. We prove that our parametric fault tests also detect all catastrophic faults.

Posttranscriptional regulation of sodium-iodide symporter mRNA expression in the rat thyroid gland by acute iodide administration. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 298: C893-C899, 2010. First published January 27, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00224.2009.-Iodide is an important regulator of thyroid activity. Its excess elicits the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, characterized by an acute suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis, which has been ascribed to serum TSH reduction or TGF-beta increase and production of iodolipids in the thyroid. These alterations take hours/days to occur, contrasting with the promptness of Wolff-Chaikoff effect. We investigated whether acute iodide administration could trigger events that precede those changes, such as reduction of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) mRNA abundance and adenylation, and if perchlorate treatment could counteract them. Rats subjected or not to methylmercaptoimidazole treatment (0.03%) received NaI (2,000 mu g/0.5 ml saline) or saline intraperitoneally and were killed 30 min up to 24 h later. Another set of animals was treated with iodide and perchlorate, in equimolar doses. NIS mRNA content was evaluated by Northern blotting and real-time PCR, and NIS mRNA poly(A) tail length by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-poly(A) test (RACE-PAT). We observed that NIS mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length were significantly reduced in all periods of iodide treatment. Perchlorate reversed these effects, indicating that iodide was the agent that triggered the modifications observed. Since the poly(A) tail length of mRNAs is directly associated with their stability and translation efficiency, we can assume that the rapid decay of NIS mRNA abundance observed was due to a reduction of its stability, a condition in which its translation could be impaired. Our data show for the first time that iodide regulates NIS mRNA expression at posttranscriptional level, providing a new mechanism by which iodide exerts its autoregulatory effect on thyroid.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 30395, "input": "Reports point to an increase in problematic uses of social networking sites that may include swearing, interpersonally deviant and disadvantageous online behaviors.

Relying on models borrowed from the offline problematic behavior (e.g., gambling, substance abuse) and neurocognitive literatures, we theorize that such behaviors are driven, in part, by elevated motor impulsivity and poor sleep quality, which is also a growing concern in modern society; and that poor sleep quality strengthens the effects of motor impulsivity on the examined range of problematic behaviors, after accounting for stress effects. To test this model we conducted a time -lagged study involving 384 young adults from the US who use social networking sites. Findings based on structural equation modeling analyses reveal that (1) motor impulsivity drives some problematic online behaviors, (2) poor sleep quality (at normative levels) does not directly influence these behaviors, and (3) poor sleep quality augments the effect of motor impulsivity on swearing, interpersonally deviant, and disadvantageous online behaviors, after accounting for stress effects.

In contrast, focal demyelination models include the stereotactic application of a toxin such as lysolecithin or ethidium bromide. The injection procedure generates a local disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and might thus trigger a local inflammatory reaction and consequently may influence demyelination and remyelination. In order to study such consequences, we applied stereotactic injections in the cuprizone model where demyelination and remyelination are mediated independent of this procedure. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the presence of lymphocytes and activated glial cells in the injection area. Blood protein stainings were used to assess the integrity of the BBB and myelin staining to evaluate demyelination and remyelination processes. Stereotactic injection led to a local disruption of the BBB as shown by local extravasation of blood proteins.

Then, we investigated the persistence of replication-competent virus in the livers of apparently resolved animals. DHBV carriers received four injections of plasmids encoding DHBV envelope and core alone or co-delivered with duck IL-2 (DuIL-2) or duck IFN- (DuIFN-) plasmids. After long-term (8months) follow-up, viral covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA was analysed in duck necropsy liver samples. Liver homogenates were also tested for in vivo infectivity in neonatal ducklings. Co-delivery of DuIFN- resulted in significantly lower mean viremia starting from week 21.

However, it is not clear how widespread chemotherapy induced \"RNA disruption\" is, the extent to which it is associated with drug response or what the underlying mechanisms are. Methods: Ovarian (A2780, CaOV3) and breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT474, SKBR3) cancer cell lines were treated with several cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs and total RNA was isolated. RNA was also prepared from docetaxel resistant A2780DXL and carboplatin resistant A2780CBN cells following drug exposure. Disruption of RNA was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Northern blotting was performed using probes complementary to the 28S and 18S rRNA to determine the origins of degradation bands. Apoptosis activation was assessed by flow cytometric monitoring of annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) binding to cells and by measuring caspase-3 activation. The link between apoptosis and RNA degradation (disruption) was investigated using a caspase-3 inhibitor. Results: All chemotherapy drugs tested were capable of inducing similar RNA disruption patterns. Docetaxel treatment of the resistant A2780DXL cells and carboplatin treatment of the A2780CBN cells did not result in RNA disruption. Northern blotting indicated that two RNA disruption bands were derived from the 3'-end of the 28S rRNA. Annexin-V and PI staining of docetaxel treated cells, along with assessment of caspase-3 activation, showed concurrent initiation of apoptosis and RNA disruption, while inhibition of caspase-3 activity significantly reduced RNA disruption. Conclusions: Supporting the in vivo evidence, our results demonstrate that RNA disruption is induced by multiple chemotherapy agents in cell lines from different tissues and is associated with drug response. Although present, the link between apoptosis and RNA disruption is not completely understood. Evaluation of RNA disruption is thus proposed as a novel and effective biomarker to assess response to chemotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 25542, "input": "Objectives.

Methods: Overall, 155 HIV-infected men and women age 19-78 were randomized into one of two intervention groups and received small prizes of US $ 1.50 awarded through a drawing conditional on either attending scheduled clinic appointments or achieving at least 90% antiretroviral adherence.

Results: Preliminary results based on pooling the intervention groups showed individuals receiving incentives were 23.7 percentage points more likely to achieve 90% antiretroviral adherence compared with the control group [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.7-40.7%]. Specifically, 63.3% (95% CI, 52.9-72.8%) of participants in the pooled intervention groups maintained at least 90% mean adherence during the first 9 months of the intervention, compared with 39.6% (95% CI, 25.8-54.7%) in the control group.

Although the physical approaches aiming to calculate the energy consumption behavior at the building level are accurate, the necessity of continuously inspecting and gathering data for all the input parameters often makes these approaches impractical in some applications. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel assessment method that investigates the correlation between LEED certification and the actual energy consumption by investigating a case study of LEED-certified research buildings in climate zone 2B. The research approach first consists of developing and testing eight performance models for 13 non-LEED buildings, and then inspecting the fit of the best model to five comparable LEED certified buildings. Heating, cooling, and electricity data are collected from all buildings, in addition to multiple weather, time, and building characteristics variables. The data are used to generate several regression models that predict the energy consumption of conventional research buildings.

Besides, current regulations on the matter focus on the physical characteristics of the buildings, relying on a strict relationship between efficiency and savings. Nevertheless, the literature shows that energy demand determinants are difficult to be estimated with the accuracy required for predictive purposes, while the energy savings stemming from efficiency gains are partly outweighed by the consumers' behavior. We deal with these issues by analyzing spatial series data of natural gas consumptions for space heating and hot water production in the residential sector. The regression analysis takes four fields of covariates into account: climate, building characteristics, market aspects, and technological development. The estimation process is based on the following cornerstones: a spatially lagged dependent variable to deal with the problem of spatial autocorrelation, linear and logarithmic functional forms, and a two-stage interpolation strategy that is meant to provide unbiased estimates of both the dispersion matrix and the t-statistics by combining Ordinary Least Squares and Weighted Least Squares. The models turn out to be well specified, and their explanatory power is high, so the results are suitable for demand forecasting. Although the spatial autoregressive term does not appear among the significant regressors, we show that space does matter in shaping the natural gas consumption in different regions. Our analysis proves that heating gas demand is characterized by a positive elasticity to income. We use these results to provide estimates of the rebound effect. Nevertheless, the additional consumption directly attributable to an income effect is of moderate magnitude when the gas price does not vary. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Design: Prospective, single center, interventional cohort (Canadian Task Force classification II-1). Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Patients: Women scheduled to undergo hysterectomy. Intervention: Patients underwent placement of the ESS505 in the right fallopian tube and ESS305 (the commercially approved previous version of the device) in the left fallopian tube at 30 (n = 10), 60 (n = 10), or 90 (n = 10) days before a planned hysterectomy. Tubal occlusion was assessed via hysterosalpingography (HSG) both at the time of placement and just before hysterectomy. Ultrasound was used to evaluate acute device placement. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-five women (mean age, 39.7 years) were enrolled from July 2012 to January 2013, and 30 underwent both ESSURE placement and scheduled hysterectomy. Mean (SD) placement time for the ESS305 and ESS505 devices was 1.4 (0.65) minutes and 1.3 (0.42) minutes, respectively (p = .36). At 1 hour after ESS505 placement, 29 of 30 tubes (97%) exhibited complete occlusion at HSG, compared with only 4 of 30 tubes (13%) after ESS305 placement (p < .001 for difference in occlusion rates). At hysterectomy, the tubal occlusion rate was high in both groups: 97% for ESS505 and 100% for ESS305 tubes. High occlusion rates were observed in each of the 3 duration groups (30, 60, and 90 days). Five women experienced only minor adverse effects. Conclusion: ESS505, a modification to the commercially available ESS305 designed to cause immediate tubal occlusion, demonstrated a high rate of both immediate-term and intermediate-term tubal occlusion. Early tubal occlusion may obviate the need for interim alternative contraceptive methods after ESSURE placement. (C) 2014 AAGL.

Little is known about the role of CHKA in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). METHODS: We performed whole-exome and transcriptome sequence analyses of 9 paired HCC and non-tumor-adjacent tissues. We performed tissue chip analyses of 120 primary HCC and non-tumor-adjacent tissues from patients who received surgery in Shanghai, China from January 2006 through December 2009; 48 sets of specimens ( HCC and non-tumor-adjacent tissues) were also analyzed. CHKA gene copy number was quantified and findings were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. CHKA messenger RNA and protein levels were determined by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analyses. CHKA was examined in 2 hepatocyte cell lines and 7 HCC-derived cell lines, and knocked down with small interfering RNAs in 3 HCC cell lines. Cells were analyzed in proliferation, wound healing, migration, and invasion assays. Cells were injected into tail veins of mice and tumor growth and metastasis were quantified. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to determine interactions between CHKA and the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2. RESULTS: Levels of CHKA messenger RNA were frequently increased in HCC tissues compared with nontumor tissues; increased expression was associated with amplification at the CHKA loci. Tumors that expressed high levels of CHKA had more aggressive phenotypes, and patients with these tumors had shorter survival times after surgery compared to patients whose tumors expressed low levels of CHKA. HCC cell lines that stably overexpressed CHKA had higher levels of migration and invasion than control HCC cells, and formed larger xenograft tumors with more metastases in mice compared to HCC cells that did not overexpress CHKA. CHKA was required for physical interaction between EGFR and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2. This complex was required for HCC cells to form metastatic xenograft tumors in mice and to become resistant to EGFR inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: We found levels of CHKA to be increased in human HCCs compared to nontumor tissues, and increased expression to be associated with tumor aggressiveness and reduced survival times of patients. Overexpression of CHKA in HCC cell lines increased their invasiveness, resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and ability to form metastatic tumors in mice by promoting interaction of EGFR with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 23811, "input": "Nowadays databases have become the backbone of cloud-based applications.

To elucidate the early molecular changes responsible for this disorder, we employed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD) isolated from parathyroid hormone-treated rats at onset of hypercalcemia-induced NDI. Forty-one proteins, including the water channel aquaporin-2, exhibited significant changes in abundance, most of which were decreased. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that many of the downregulated proteins were associated with cytoskeletal protein binding, regulation of actin filament polymerization, and cell-cell junctions. Targeted LC-MS/MS and immunoblot studies confirmed the downregulation of 16 proteins identified in the initial proteomic analysis and in additional experiments using a vitamin D treatment model of hypercalcemia-induced NDI. Evaluation of transcript levels and estimated half-life of the downregulated proteins suggested enhanced protein degradation as the possible regulatory mechanism. Electron microscopy showed defective intercellular junctions and autophagy in the IMCD cells from both vitamin D- and parathyroid hormone-treated rats. A significant increase in the number of autophagosomes was confirmed by immunofluorescence labeling of LC3. Colocalization of LC3 and Lamp1 with aquaporin-2 and other downregulated proteins was found in both models. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed aquaporin-2 in autophagosomes in IMCD cells from both hypercalcemia models. Finally, parathyroid hormone withdrawal reversed the NDI phenotype, accompanied by termination of aquaporin-2 autophagic degradation and normalization of both nonphoshorylated and S256-phosphorylated aquaporin-2 levels.

The specific response of an individual patient to any one of the MS therapies remains largely unpredictable, and physicians and patients are forced to use a trial and error approach when deciding on treatment regimens. A priori markers to predict the optimal benefit-to-risk profile of an individual MS patient would greatly facilitate the decision-making process, thereby helping the patient receive the most optimal treatment early on in the disease process.

The advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are the consequence of non-enzymatic reactions between lipid and protein with several oxidants in the aging process. The receptor for AGEs (RAGEs) has been implicated in the lung fibrotic process and the alveolar homeostasis. However, this AGE-RAGE aging pathway has been under-explored in IPF. Methods: Lung samples from 16 IPF and 9 control patients were obtained through surgical lung biopsy. Differences in AGEs and RAGE expression between both groups were evaluated by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The effect of AGEs on cell viability of primary lung fibrotic fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells was assessed. Cell transformation of fibrotic fibroblasts cultured into glycated matrices was evaluated in different experimental conditions. Results: Our study demonstrates an increase of AGEs together with a decrease of RAGEs in IPF lungs, compared with control samples. Two specific AGEs involved in aging, pentosidine and Ne-Carboxymethyl lysine, were significantly increased in IPF samples. The immunohistochemistry identified higher staining of AGEs related to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and the apical surface of the alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) surrounding fibroblast foci in fibrotic lungs. On the other hand, RAGE location was present at the cell membrane of AECs in control lungs, while it was almost missing in pulmonary fibrotic tissue. In addition, in vitro cultures showed that the effect of AGEs on cell viability was different for AECs and fibrotic fibroblasts. AGEs decreased cell viability in AECs, even at low concentration, while fibroblast viability was less affected. Furthermore, fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation could be enhanced by ECM glycation. Conclusions: All of these findings suggest a possible role of the increased ratio AGEs-RAGEs in IPF, which could be a relevant accelerating aging tissue reaction in the abnormal wound healing of the lung fibrotic process.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 38418, "input": "The signal flow graph (SFG) nonlinear modeling approach is well known for modeling dc-dc converters and it is a powerful analysis tool for higher order converter systems.

Both ectoines possess the ability to preserve the functionality of proteins, macromolecular complexes, and even entire cells, attributes that led to their description as chemical chaperones. As a consequence, there is growing interest in using ectoines for biotechnological purposes, in skin care, and in medical applications. 5-Hydroxyectoine is synthesized from ectoine through a region-and stereo-specific hydroxylation reaction mediated by the EctD enzyme, a member of the non-heme-containing iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. This chemical modification endows the newly formed 5-hydroxyectoine with either superior or different stress-protecting and stabilizing properties. Microorganisms producing 5-hydroxyectoine typically contain a mixture of both ectoines. We aimed to establish a recombinant microbial cell factory where 5-hydroxyectoine is (i) produced in highly purified form, and (ii) secreted into the growth medium. Results: We used an Escherichia coli strain (FF4169) defective in the synthesis of the osmostress protectant trehalose as the chassis for our recombinant cell factory. We expressed in this strain a plasmid-encoded ectD gene from Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 under the control of the anhydrotetracycline-inducible tet promoter. We chose the ectoine hydroxylase from P. stutzeri A1501 for our cell factory after a careful comparison of the in vivo performance of seven different EctD proteins. In the final set-up of the cell factory, ectoine was provided to salt-stressed cultures of strain FF4169 (pMP41; ectD(+)). Ectoine was imported into the cells via the osmotically inducible ProP and ProU transport systems, intracellularly converted to 5-hydroxyectoine, which was then almost quantitatively secreted into the growth medium. Experiments with an E. coli mutant lacking all currently known mechanosensitive channels (MscL, MscS, MscK, MscM) revealed that the release of 5-hydroxyectoine under osmotic steady-state conditions occurred independently of these microbial safety valves. In shake-flask experiments, 2.13 g l(-1) ectoine (15 mM) was completely converted into 5-hydroxyectoine within 24 h.

The results showed higher removal rates for OXC compared to persulfate alone, electrocoagulation alone, and the ferrous-activated persulfate (Fe2+/PS) process. A kinetic model regarding all of the reactive species was developed, and the model fitted the experimental data well. The second-order rate constants for OXC reacting with hydroxyl (OH) and sulfate (SO4(-)) radical were calculated to be 2.43 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and 3.55 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively, based on a relative rate technique. Both OH and SO4(-) substantially contributed to OXC degradation, whereas the contribution of SO4(-) was higher than that of OH. When the current density increased, the removal rates of OXC increased at low current densities and then decreased at high current densities. In particular, the degradation of OXC was significantly enhanced with increasing persulfate dosages. The pH affected the speciation of iron in solution, which in turn led to the poorly removal rate under alkaline conditions, whereas natural organic matter (NOM) dramatically inhibited the degradation of OXC by consuming OH and SO4(-) radicals. In addition, the efficient removal rates of para-chlorobenzoic acid, antipyrine, carbamazepine, and tetracycline under similar reaction conditions were also confirmed.

Methods: Age-standardized mortality rates of breast cancer per 100,000 person-years were calculated. Relative index of inequality (RII) for breast cancer mortality was used as an inequality measure. APC analyses were conducted using the Web tool for APC analysis provided by the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Results: An increasing trend in breast cancer mortality among Korean women between 1983 and 2012 was due to the increased mortality of the lower education groups (i.e., no formal education or primary education and secondary education groups), not the highest education group. The breast cancer mortality was higher in women with a tertiary education than in women with no education or a primary education during 1983-1992, and the reverse was true in 1993-2012.

Assessment of ecological recovery at oil and gas pads on the Colorado Plateau with DART revealed that more than half of well-pads were below the 25th percentile of reference areas. Machine learning trend analysis of poorly recovering well-pads (quantile < 0.23) had out of-bag error rates between 37 and 40% indicating moderate association with environmental and management variables hypothesized to influence recovery. Well-pads in grasslands (median quantile (MQ] = 13%), blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) shrublands (MQ = 18%), arid canyon complexes (MQ = 18%), warmer areas with more summer-dominated precipitation, and state administered areas (MQ = 12%) had low recovery rates. Results showcase the usefulness of DART for assessing discrete surface land disturbances, and highlight the need for more targeted rehabilitation efforts at oil and gas well-pads in the arid southwest US.

Characterized by lengthy cytoplasmic extensions that can reach tens of microns and are called telopodes (Tps), TCs are difficult to see using conventional microscopes. It was the electron microscopy which led to their first identification and Popescu's team the first responsible for the reconstructions indicating TCs 'organization' in a three-dimensional (3D) network that is believed to be accountable for the complex roles of TCs. Gradually, it became increasingly evident that TCs are difficult to characterize in terms of immunophenotype and that their phenotype is different depending on the location and needs of the tissue at one time. This review discusses the growing body of evidence accumulated since TCs were discovered and highlights how the complex interplay between TCs and stem cells might be of importance for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

The mixture of biological components and soil particles that form the crust, in conjunction with moisture, determines the biocrusts' spectral signatures. Proximal and remote sensing in complemeritary spectral regions, namely the reflective region, and the thermal region, have been used to study biocrusts in a non-destructive manner, in the laboratory, in the field, and from space. The objectives of this review paper are to present the spectral characteristics of biocrusts across the optical domain, and to discuss significant developments in the application of proximal and remote sensing for biocrust studies in the last few years. The motivation for using proximal and remote sensing in biocrust studies is disttissed. Next, the application of reflectance spectroscopy to the study of biocrusts is presented followed by a review of the emergence of high spectral resolution thermal remote sensing, Which facilitates the application of thermal spectroscopy for biocrust studies. Four specific topics at the forefront of proximal and remote sensing of biocrusts are discussed: (1) The use of remote sensing in determining the role of biocrusts in global biogeochemical cycles; (2) Monitoring the inceptive establishment of biocrusts; (3) Identifying and characterizing biocrusts using Longwave infrared spectroscopy; and (4) Diurnal emissivity dynamics of biocrusts in a sand dune environment. The paper concludes by identifying innovative technologies such as low altitude and high resolution imagery that are increasingly used in remote sensing science, and are expected to be used in future biocrusts studies.

Juveniles who commit homicide are often tried in adult court and typically spend the majority of their lives in prison. Despite the enormous costs associated with homicidal behavior, there have been no serious neuroscientific studies examining youth who commit homicide. Methods: Here we use neuroimaging and voxel-based morphometry to examine brain gray matter in incarcerated male adolescents who committed homicide (n = 20) compared with incarcerated offenders who did not commit homicide (n = 135). Two additional control groups were used to understand further the nature of gray matter differences: incarcerated offenders who did not commit homicide matched on important demographic and psychometric variables (n = 20) and healthy participants from the community (n = 21). Results: Compared with incarcerated adolescents who did not commit homicide (n = 135), incarcerated homicide offenders had reduced gray matter volumes in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and posterior insula. Feature selection and support vector machine learning classified offenders into the homicide and non-homicide groups with 81% overall accuracy. Conclusions: Our results indicate that brain structural differences may help identify those at the highest risk for committing serious violent offenses. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The current study examined the relationship between three self-report measures of psychological distress and ratings obtained from the corresponding clinician-administered measures in women seeking assessment for mental health problems following IPV (N = 185). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the self-report Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the interview-based Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Depression symptoms were assessed using the self-report Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the depressive disorders sections from the clinician-administered Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV). Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the self-report Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the clinician-administered GAD section from the ADIS-IV. Results indicated that psychological distress was prevalent in the sample, with 27% receiving a PTSD diagnosis, 40% diagnosed with a depressive disorder, and 55% meeting criteria for GAD. Although each self-report measure was significantly and positively correlated with its corresponding clinician-administered measure, rates of diagnostic concordance were mixed. The BDI-II showed a high degree of agreement with the ADIS-IV depression section, but the IES-R and the CAPS were discordant at classifying PTSD. The BAI had acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity in relation to the ADIS-IV GAD section.

Prior to conducting the examination, there are examinations of the relationships among the quality management system (QMS) variables. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed a survey questionnaire of construction industry practitioners who have experience in building and civil engineering works. The Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument was selected due to its suitability in assessing organisation's underlying culture. Findings - Within the examination among the QMS variables, it was found that problematic issues associated with the implementation of QMS-ISO 9001: 2008 in Indonesian construction companies can affect the implementation of the QMS and contribute to the lower level of companies' business performance. It was also found that there is no significant relationship between the QMS implementation and the companies' business performance. By using the Competing Values Framework diagram, it was found that most of the construction companies' organisational culture is characterised by a Clan type which is reflected in how employees are managed, how the organisation is held together, and how the organisation's success is defined; the leadership style is Hierarchy-focused, while the organisation's strategy is Market type. It was also found that different culture profiles have different influences on the QMS implementation.

Purpose Low compliance to anti-osteoporosis medications (AOM) has been previously reported. We aimed to estimate 1-year cessation rates of different AOMs as used in Spanish healthcare settings, and to identify associated risk factors. Methods A cohort study was performed using primary care records data (BIFAP). Patients entered the cohort when aged 50 years in 2001-2013, with >= 1 year of data available, and identified as incident users of AOM (1-year washout). Participants were divided into six cohorts: alendronate, other oral bisphosphonates, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, and denosumab. Patients were followed from therapy initiation to the earliest of cessation (90-day refill gap), switching (to alternative AOM), loss to follow-up, death, or end of 2013. One-year therapy cessation was estimated using life tables. Hazard ratios (of cessation) according to age, sex, lifestyle factors, morbidity, and co-medication were estimated after stepwise backwards selection. Results A total of 95,057 AOM users were identified (91% women; mean age 68). One-year cessation was 51% overall, highest for strontium ranelate (68%), and lowest for denosumab (28%). Cessation probability was higher in men (14% to 2.1-fold), smokers (>6%), and patients with missing BMI (19-28%) or smoking (6-20%) data, and overweight/obese/underweight (7% to 2.6-fold increase compared to normal weight). Patients aged 60-79 years, with a recent fracture or other drugs used for osteoporosis, had better persistence. Conclusions Over half of the patients initiating AOM stopped therapy within the first year after initiation.

These populations display heterogeneity of unknown significance. We hypothesized that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, a functional marker of primitivity, could help to better define ASC and PC subclasses. To this end, the stromal vascular fraction from a human lipoaspirate was simultaneously stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD31, CD45, CD34, and CD146 antigens and the ALDH substrate Aldefluor, then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Individual ASCs (n=67) and PCs (n=73) selected from the extremities of the ALDH-staining spectrum were transcriptionally profiled by Fluidigm single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction for a predefined set (n=429) of marker genes. To these single-cell data, we applied differential expression and principal component and clustering analysis, as well as an original gene coexpression network reconstruction algorithm. Despite the stochasticity at the single-cell level, covariation of gene expression analysis yielded multiple network connectivity parameters suggesting that these perivascular progenitor cell subclasses possess the following order of maturity: (a) ALDH(br)ASC (most primitive); (b) ALDH(dim)ASC; (c) ALDH(br)PC; (d) ALDH(dim)PC (least primitive). This order was independently supported by specific combinations of class-specific expressed genes and further confirmed by the analysis of associated signaling pathways. In conclusion, single-cell transcriptional analysis of four populations isolated from fat by surface markers and enzyme activity suggests a developmental hierarchy among perivascular mesenchymal stem cells supported by markers and coexpression networks.

But the traditional CTRC system with a basic configuration (B-CTRC) has a poor thermodynamic performance. This paper introduces an improved CTRC system containing both a preheater and regenerator (PR-CTRC), for recovering waste heat in exhaust gas and engine coolant of an engine, and compares its performance with that of the B-CTRC system and also with that of the traditional excellent Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems using R123 as a working fluid. The utilization rate of waste heat, total cooling load, net power output, thermal efficiency, exergy loss, exergy efficiency and component size have been investigated. Results show that, the net power output of the PR-CTRC could reach up to 9.0 kW for a 43.8 kW engine, which increases by 150% compared with that of the B-CTRC (3.6 kW). The PR-CTRC also improves the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the B-CTRC, with increases of 184% and 227%, respectively. Compared with the ORC system, the PR-CTRC shows the significant advantage of highly recycling the exhaust gas and engine coolant simultaneously due to the special property of supercritical CO2's specific heat capacity. The supercritical property of CO2 also generates a better heat transfer and flowing performances. Meanwhile, the PR-CTRC possesses a smaller SP (0.010-0.020 m) than that of R123 systems (0.055-0.070 m).

The aimof this studywas to analyze the recent patterns of In resistance in treatment naive individuals in Northern Poland and its association with transmitted protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations. Methods: Study included 172 PR, RT and InI sequences from antiretroviral treatment naive HIV-1 infected patients linked to care in Northern Poland from 2010 to 2015. Drug resistance was interpreted based on the WHO surveillance and IAS-USA mutation lists. For phylogeny maximum likelihood and Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain analyses were used. Results: Overall rate of transmitted drug resistancewas 12.21%. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance associated substitutionswere found in 11.05% of cases and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance variants in 1.16%. In multivariate models transmitted resistance strongly associated with subtype D infections [66.67% compared to the 3.84% for subtype B (p = 0.001)]. No transmission of major protease or integrasemutationswere observed. Polymorphisms associatedwith resistance against integrase inhibitor, mostly E157Q, were found in 21.5% sequences and associated with female (31.91% vs. 15.2% for male, p = 0.01), injection drug use (84.21% compared to 22.08% for heterosexual and 1.39% for men-who-have-sex-with-men transmissions, p<0.0001) as well as hepatitis C coinfection [63.64% for positive, versus 8.57% for HCV antibody negative, p<0.0001]. Clusters of nucleoside reverse transcriptase mutations in subtype D and integrase E157Q variants in subtype B were observed. Conclusions: Transmitted drug resistance frequency was high in subtype D but limited to clustered NRTI mutations, being infrequent among subtype B infected cases. Despite lack of major integrase resistance in treatment naive patients, variants potentially affecting susceptibility to this classwere common, which indicates the potential need for extended surveillance in the near future.

Results: Only three studies were identified that related to transmeridian travel and jetlag in people with mood disorders.

Individuals with a previous history of mood disorder appear to be more vulnerable if adherence to medication is compromised.

They have been used to identify the dose emission characteristics from a fixed dosed combination of 200 mu g budesonide plus 611,mu g formoterol Turbuhaler (R). To isolate each inhalation parameter some profiles were modified to provide a further 9 profiles to study the influence of V-in, and 27 to identify the effect of ACIM. The fine particle dose, total emitted dose and mass median aerodynamic diameter were significantly (p <0.05) influenced by PIF (p <0.05) whereas ACIM and Vin had only a small effect. The results show the value of this ex-vivo methodology to provide an insight into the dose that each patient would have inhaled during real-life use. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The negative impacts of animal production on the environment must be reduced, which implies a reduction of nutrient losses to the environment associated with animal production. Feed efficiency, mostly expressed as feed conversion ratio (FCR), is a key indicator to judge the financial and environmental performance of a farming system. In intensive rabbit breeding, the average farm FCR (maternity + fattening units) in European farms improved from 3.8 to 3.4 during the past 15 years. This translates into a drop in nitrogen and phosphorus output of approximately 10%. This improvement can be attributed to progress in health control, nutritional factors and strategies, management and genetics. To optimize rabbit farm FCR, the reproducing stock as well as the fattening unit must be considered. This review summarizes the impact of different strategies to optimize FCR under intensive production conditions, where rabbits are exclusively fed a pelleted diet. High performing reproduction stock results in a lower FCR in maternity. The use of diets with nutrient levels to optimize digestive health, together with an appropriate feeding restriction after weaning, leads to minimal losses and has a large impact on the FCR. If the different fiber requirements are met, an increase of the dietary energy level, especially in the finishing stage, reduces the FCR by approximately 0.15 points, for an increase of 0.5 MJ DE. Future possibilities for genetic selection for feed efficiency are based on improvements to the residual feed intake. It seems possible to improve feed efficiency further by reducing feed intake without affecting weight gain. Such a genetic improvement would reduce both feed input (reducing costs) and output (reducing environmental impacts). An average farm FCR of 3.0, similar to that of pig breeding, can be reached in the next decade for rabbit meat production. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The key ingredients in the algorithm design include exploiting the combinatorial properties of the problems and making use of tree decomposition and minimum weighted maximum matching techniques. Specifically, given a metric complete graph G and an integer k >0, we consider rootless, uncapacitated rooted, and capacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problems in G with an aim to find k rootless (or rooted) edge-disjoint cycles covering the vertices in V such that the maximum cycle weight among the k cycles is minimized. For each of the mentioned problems, we develop an improved approximate solution. That is, for the rootless min-max cycle cover problem, we develop a (5 1/3 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm; for the uncapacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problem, we devise a (6 1/3 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm; and for the capacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problem, we propose a (7 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm. These algorithms improve the best existing approximation ratios of the corresponding problems 6 + epsilon, 7 + epsilon, and 13 + epsilon, respectively, where epsilon is a constant with 0 < + < 1.

Sports medicine has matured as a focused discipline within primary care with the number of primary care sports medicine physicians growing annually. The practices of these physicians range from ''part-time'' sports medicine as a part of a broader practice in their primary specialty, to functioning as a full-time team physician for a university or college. Managed care organizations are increasingly incorporating primary care sports medicine providers into their organizations. The optimal role of these providers in a managed care system has not been described. METHODS. A descriptive analysis was made of patient contacts in a referral-based, free-standing primary care sports medicine clinic associated with a large managed care system. This study describes patient information including demographic data, referral source, primary diagnosis, specialized diagnostic testing, and subsequent specialty consultation. RESULTS. A total of 1857 patient contacts were analyzed. New patients were referred from a full range of physicians both primary care (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, and emergency physicians) and other specialists, with family practice clinic providers (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) accounting for the largest percentage of new referrals. The majority of patient visits were for orthopedic injuries (95.4%); the most frequently involved injury sites were: knee (26.5%), shoulder (18.2%), back (14.3%), and ankle (10%). The most common types of injury were: tendinitis (21.3%), chronic anterior knee pain (10.6%), and ligament sprains (9.9%). Specialized testing was requested for 8% of all patients. The majority of patients were treated at the Ft Belvoir Sports Medicine Clinic by primary care sports medicine physicians without further specialty referral, CONCLUSIONS. Primary care sports medicine physicians offer an intermediate level of care for patients while maintaining a practice in their primary care specialty. This dual practice is ideal in the managed care setting.

The three-input amplifier that standalone DD active electrodes require is inherently different from a differential amplifier, and general knowledge about its design is scarce in the literature. First, the figures of merit of the amplifier are defined through a decomposition of its input signal into three orthogonal modes. This analysis reveals a mode containing EMG crosstalk components that the DD electrode should reject. Then, the effect of finite input impedance is analyzed. Because there are three terminals, minimum bounds for interference rejection ratios due to electrode and input impedance unbalances with two degrees of freedom are obtained. Finally, a novel circuit design is presented, including only a quadruple operational amplifier and a few passive components. This design is nearly as simple as the branched electrode and much simpler than the three instrumentation amplifier design, while providing robust EMG crosstalk rejection and better input impedance using unity gain buffers for each electrode input.

Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing.

The purpose of this study is to train care counsellors of statutory long term care insurances in problem-solving and to evaluate this approach as an additional component in the statutory care counselling in Germany. Methods: A pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial in which 38 sites with 58 care counsellors are randomly assigned to provide either routine counselling plus additional problem-solving for caregivers or routine counselling alone. The counsellor training comprises an initial 2-day training, a follow-up day after 4 months, and biweekly supervision contacts with a psychotherapist for 6 months over the phone. The agreed minimum counselling intensity is one initial face-to-face contact including a caregiver assessment and at least one telephone follow-up contact. Caregivers who are positively screened for significant strain in their role are followed up at 3 and 6 months after baseline assessment. Main outcome are caregivers' depressive symptoms. Discussion: While it is unclear if the expected very low amount of additional counselling time is sufficient to yield any additional effects on caregiver depression, it is also unclear if the additional problem-solving component yields to synergies with routine counselling that is based on information and case management.

High-Frequency Gravitational Waves (HFGWs) pass through most material with little or no attenuation, but although they are not absorbed their polarization, phase velocity (causing refraction or bending of GWs) and/or other characteristics can be modified by a material object's texture and internal structure. For example, the change in polarization of a GW passing through a material object is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973). Specifically, \"If the wave is a pulse, then the backscatter will cause its shape and polarization to keep changing...\" Such an assertion will need to be verified both theoretically and experimentally, but the potential payoffs are enormous. Applications of this technology include satellite-based surveillance systems to image subterranean weapons of mass destruction or WMDs, personnel of interest inside and behind buildings, deeply submerged submarines, hidden missiles and rockets, oil and mineral deposits, etc. as well as acoustical surveillance. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory or LIGO and other interferometer detectors cannot detect HFGWs due to the HFGW's short wavelengths as discussed by Shawhan (2004). Long-wavelength gravitational waves having thousand and million meter wavelengths, which can be detected by LIGO, are of no practical surveillance value due to their diffraction and resulting poor resolution. Short HFGW wavelengths of a few meters to fractions of a millimeter and the sensitivity of the HFGW generator-detector system to polarization angle changes of yoctoradians to 10(-40) radians could afford suitable resolution for practical surveillance systems.", "class": "Civil Engineering"}, {"id": 39295, "input": "There are few long-term studies on the midurethral sling (MUS) procedure in patients with preoperative detrusor overactivity (DO) and there is debate regarding the usefulness of preoperative cystometry.

Pyrethroid use has increased continuously in recent years. The aim of this review is to provide updated and comprehensive information on human exposure and potential hazards associated with this class of pesticides. An initial keyword search in the PubMed database was conducted to identify relevant articles. Were taken into considerations only the studies published in the last decade that have assessed exposure and health effects of pyrethroids in human populations. Literature review shows that exposure evaluations increasingly focus on biomonitoring and that a large number of recent epidemiological studies pertain to the effects of pyrethroids on male fertility and prenatal development. The main metabolites of pyrethroids have frequently been detected in urine samples from the general population, confirming widespread exposure of children and adults to one or more pyrethroids. Nonoccupational exposure to pyrethroids mainly occurs through ingestion of residues in food, or ingestion of or dermal contact with contaminated house dust or surface-adhering particles, following domestic use. Although clinical features resulting from acute accidental exposure to pyrethroids are well described (e.g., paraesthesiae, and respiratory, eye and skin irritation), information regarding their chronic effects at low concentrations is both limited and controversial. Several recent epidemiological studies have raised concerns about potentially adverse effects on sperm quality and sperm DNA, reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Early neurobehavioural development after in utero exposure is discussed. Further research is needed to clarify the possible risks associated with long-term environmental exposure to pyrethroids.

Our aims were (i) to compare self-reported and parent-reported HRQL in different age groups, (ii) to evaluate the impact of severity of allergic reaction and threshold on HRQL, and (iii) to investigate factors associated with patient-reported and parent-reported HRQL. Methods Age-appropriate Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaires (FAQLQ) were completed by 73 children, 49 adolescents and 29 adults with peanut, hazelnut or egg allergy. Parents (197 mothers, 120 fathers) assessed their child's HRQL using the FAQLQ-Parent form. Clinical data and threshold values were obtained from a hospital database. Significant factors for HRQL were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression. Results Female patients reported greater impact of food allergy on HRQL than males did. Egg and hazelnut thresholds did not affect HRQL, but lower peanut threshold was associated with worse HRQL. Both parents scored their child's HRQL better than the child's own assessment, but whereas mother-reported HRQL was significantly affected by limitations in the child's social life, father-reported HRQL was affected by limitations in the family's social life.

A common implementation of an electrochemical readout is a potentiostat, which usually includes potentiometric, amperometric, and impedimetric detection. Recently several researchers have developed small, low-cost, single-chip silicon-based potentiostats. With the advances in heterogeneous integration technology, low-power potentiostats can be implemented on paper and similar low cost substrates. This paper deals with the design of a low-power paper-based amperometric front-end for a low-cost and rapid detection environment. In amperometric detection a voltage signal is provided to a sensor system, while a small current value generated by an electrochemical redox reaction in the system is measured. In order to measure low current values, the noise of the circuit must be minimized, which is accomplished with a pre-amplification front-end stage, typically designed around an operational amplifier core. An appropriate circuit design for a low-power and low-cost amperometric front-end is identified, taking the heterogeneous integration of various components into account. The operational amplifier core is on a bare custom CMOS chip, which will be integrated onto the paper substrate alongside commercial off-the-shelf electronic components. A general-purpose low-power two-stage CMOS amplifier circuit is designed and simulated for the ams 350 nm 5 V process. After the layout design and verification, the IC was submitted for a multi-project wafer manufacturing run.

However, the contribution of substance use across adolescence to poor sexual outcomes in young adulthood has not been investigated in depth, despite offering opportunities for more targeted prevention. This study aimed to estimate joint trajectories of adolescent alcohol and marijuana use to determine if they relate differently to four sexual outcomes: multiple sexual partners, sex without a condom, teenage pregnancy, and contraction of a sexually transmitted infection in young adulthood (by age 25). Data came from a longitudinal study of urban youth followed from age 6 to age 25, with annual assessments during adolescence and young adulthood (n = 608). The sample showed high levels of sexual risk, with young adults on average having sex without a condom once in the past month, 28.5% having multiple sexual partners in the past month, one quarter having contracted a sexually transmitted infection, and over 60% of the women being pregnant as a teenager and 36% of the men having gotten a partner pregnant. Applying longitudinal latent profile analysis to estimate joint trajectories of alcohol and marijuana use from grades 8-12, we identified four classes representing high dual use, moderate alcohol use, moderate alcohol use with increasing marijuana use, and non-use.

Among existing methods, the high sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) is attractive to achieve that goal. The aim of this study was to perform a quantitative comparison of brain images obtained in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats using two dopaminergic PET radiotracers, namely [F-18]fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine ([F-18]FDOPA) and 6-[F-18]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine ([F-18]FMT). Because the imaging signal is theoretically less contaminated by metabolites, we hypothesized that the latter would show stronger relationship with behavioural and post-mortem measures of striatal dopaminergic deficiency. We used a within-subject design to measure striatal [F-18]FMT and [F-18]FDOPA uptake in eight partially lesioned, eight fully lesioned and ten sham-treated rats. Animals were pretreated with an L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor. A catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor was also given before [F-18]FDOPA PET. Quantitative estimates of striatal uptake were computed using conventional graphical Patlak method. Striatal dopaminergic deficiencies were measured with apomorphine-induced rotations and post-mortem striatal DA content. We observed a strong relationship between [F-18]FMT and [F-18]FDOPA estimates of decreased uptake in the denervated striatum using the tissue-derived uptake rate constant K-c. However, only [F-18]FMT K-c succeeded to discriminate between the partial and the full 6-OHDA lesion and correlated well with the post-mortem striatal DA content.

Infestation loads with the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, are heritable: some breeds carry high loads of reproductively successful ticks, whereas in others, few ticks feed and reproduce efficiently. Methods: In order to elucidate the mechanisms that result in the different outcomes of infestations with cattle ticks, we examined global gene expression and inflammation induced by tick bites in skins from one resistant and one susceptible breed of cattle that underwent primary infestations with larvae and nymphs of R. microplus. We also examined the expression profiles of genes encoding secreted tick proteins that mediate parasitism in larvae and nymphs feeding on these breeds. Results: Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes in the skin suggest that allergic contact-like dermatitis develops with ensuing production of IL-6, CXCL-8 and CCL-2 and is sustained by HMGB1, ISG15 and PKR, leading to expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that recruit granulocytes and T lymphocytes. Importantly, this response is delayed in susceptible hosts. Histopathological analyses of infested skins showed inflammatory reactions surrounding tick cement cones that enable attachment in both breeds, but in genetically tick-resistant bovines they destabilized the cone. The transcription data provided insights into tick-mediated activation of basophils, which have previously been shown to be a key to host resistance in model systems. Skin from tick-susceptible bovines expressed more transcripts encoding enzymes that detoxify tissues. Interestingly, these enzymes also produce volatile odoriferous compounds and, accordingly, skin rubbings from tick-susceptible bovines attracted significantly more tick larvae than rubbings from resistant hosts. Moreover, transcripts encoding secreted modulatory molecules by the tick were significantly more abundant in larval and in nymphal salivary glands from ticks feeding on susceptible bovines. Conclusions: Compared with tick-susceptible hosts, genes encoding enzymes producing volatile compounds exhibit significantly lower expression in resistant hosts, which may render them less attractive to larvae; resistant hosts expose ticks to an earlier inflammatory response, which in ticks is associated with significantly lower expression of genes encoding salivary proteins that suppress host immunity, inflammation and coagulation.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 18589, "input": "In this paper, we conduct research on the construction and optimization approaches for the housing construction process control system based on enterprise resources planning system and data analysis model.

Cross-sectional research suggests that IIV increases with normal and neuropathological ageing and it may serve as a marker of neurobiological integrity. This raises the possibility that IIV may also predict future cognitive decline and, indeed, neuropathology. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to address these issues. Methods: A search of electronic databases Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was completed on May 17, 2016 that identified longitudinal investigations of IIV in middle-aged or older adults. Results: A total of 688 studies were initially identified of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Nine included longitudinal IIV measures and 17 predicted subsequent outcome (cognitive decline or impairment, dementia, mortality) from baseline IIV. The results suggested IIV increased over time, particularly in participants aged over 75 years. Greater baseline IIV was consistently associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including cognitive decline or impairment, and mortality. Conclusions: Increased IIV over time is associated with normal ageing. However, further increases in IIV over and above those found in normal ageing may be a risk factor for future cognitive impairment or mortality.

Based on criminal patterns, the APD group was then divided into two subgroups: \"criminal\" and \"noncriminal\" APD groups. The day after the interview, after one night of fasting, blood was collected from the subjects between 7: 00 a.m. and 9: 00 a.m.. Thyroid function tests and other biochemical analyses related to the confounding variables were also administered. The study group and the control group were compared in terms of their aggression scores and thyroid hormone levels. Results: The mean score of free T3 level in the criminal APD group was found to be significantly higher than that in the noncriminal APD group. APD subjects with higher free T3 levels also had higher aggression scores. In the noncriminal APD group, as serum free T3 and T4 levels increased, there was also an increment in the aggression scores. However, in the criminal APD group, there was no significant correlation between thyroid hormone levels and aggression. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that criminal and noncriminal APD groups actually show different properties.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 20150, "input": "Introduction: Dedicated progestin-only emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) have been available with a prescription in Brazil since 1999. However, utilization of emergency contraception has been limited. We conducted a mystery client study at retail pharmacies in three regions to assess current availability. Methods: Using a predetermined client profile, we approached a random sample of chain and independent pharmacies in urban areas in the southeastern, northeastern and central-west regions. We documented product availability, price and the client-pharmacy representative interaction at each site. We analyzed these data with descriptive statistics and for content and themes. Results: We visited 122 pharmacies in early 2016. All but three pharmacies (97.5%) had ECPs in stock at the time of the interaction and offered our client the medication without a prescription. In general, pharmacy representatives did not ask questions or provide our client with information about emergency contraception. When prompted, over one third of the pharmacy representatives (37.7%) inaccurately reported that levonorgestrel ECPs could only be used immediately or within 12, 24 or 48 h from the time of intercourse. Conclusion: Despite the current regulatory status, our findings suggest that progestin-only ECPs are widely available without a prescription. Additional efforts to ensure that women have up-to-date and medically accurate information about progestin-only ECPs appear warranted. Our findings suggest that more work needs to be done to align national regulatory policies with international standards and evidence-based practices. Implications: The Zika virus epidemic has shined a spotlight on the importance of providing timely access to emergency contraception in Latin America. This public health emergency offers a window of opportunity to advance national policies and practices to ensure that Brazilian women have access to a full range of reproductive health services.

Lifetime prevalence of crack cocaine use was 2.51 %, and it was higher among males and individuals coming from more vulnerable social classes (D or E). In the final multivariate models, lifetime use of crack cocaine was associated with episodes of aggression and firearm possession, as well as with a higher chance of not having used condom in the last sexual intercourse. In less conservative models, crack cocaine use was associated with other violent and sexual risk behaviors. The strong association observed between lifetime use of crack cocaine and different violent and sexual risk behaviors underscores relevant characteristics of people who use crack cocaine.

In a sample of adolescents (N = 196; mean age = 13.9 years; 63 % female) and their mothers (N = 185; mean age = 44 years), we first examined mean-level differences between the two domains in terms of mothers' degree and style of prohibition, as well as on a number of developmental outcomes (i.e., adolescents' legitimacy perceptions, internalization, and oppositional defiance). Both adolescents and mothers reported more maternal involvement in the moral domain (e.g., higher scores for degree of prohibition and controlling communication style). In addition, adolescents reported greater perceived legitimacy and less oppositional defiance in the moral domain (as compared to the friendships domain). Second, we tested whether associations between degree and style of prohibition and the developmental outcomes were moderated by social domain. Whereas associations between degree of prohibition and developmental outcomes either were non-significant or moderated by domain, the associations with communication style were more domain-invariant, with an autonomy-supportive style generally yielding an adaptive pattern of correlates and with a controlling style relating to maladaptive outcomes.

This feature raises cost-recovery issues for storage, due to the combination of competitive markets and ratebased cost recovery used in many power systems today. This hybrid regulatory paradigm relies on classifying assets as providing competitively prices or unpriced services and handling cost recovery based on that classification. Some recent regulatory precedents suggest that storage developers must choose between classifying their assets as providing competitively priced or unpriced services. In the former case, storage costs must be recovered through the market. If an asset is classified as providing only unpriced services, costs can be recovered through the ratebase. This regulatory design can hamper cost recovery for storage and may lead to inefficient storage investment and use. We propose an alternate solution whereby storage-capacity rights are auctioned to third parties that use their rights for priced or unpriced services. Storage-capacity rights disentangle storage cost recovery from the regulatory treatment of its end use. We formulate the storage-capacity auction model and demonstrate how to efficiently price storage-capacity rights.

We describe a case series of 21 patients with SAPHO and their response to several pharmacological treatments. Methods: Clinical and biochemical data, along with medical imaging, were collected from the medical records of 21 patients, diagnosed as SAPHO during follow-up between 2005 and 2013. Symptoms and inflammatory markers were recorded twice, once at first patient presentation, and once at the end of follow-up. Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis were labeled as defining features. All treatment options were categorized according to their respective responses (full remission, partial remission, and no disease control). Results: There was a female predominance and a median age of 32 years (range: 12-54 years). Median follow-up duration was 45 months (range: 0-188 months). Total prevalence of defining features in this cohort increased for each defining feature during follow-up, except for acne. All patients reached full or partial remission at the end of follow-up. A total of 14 patients were treated with bisphosphonates. Of which 8 of them went into full or partial remission. Discussion and conclusion: In our case series, none of the patients had the full presentation of SAPHO at the first consultation. Some presented with symptoms suggestive for psoriatic arthritis. This explains why diagnosis of SAPHO can be challenging. Full remission was induced in the majority of individuals. Bisphosphonates seem to be a noteworthy treatment option.

The processing scheme adopted in the proposed system focused on two steps. The first step was to enhance cervical cell FE-SEM images in order to show the precancerous characterization indicator. A problem arises from the question of how to extract features which characterize cervical precancerous cells. For the first step, a preprocessing technique called intensity transformation and morphological operation (ITMO) algorithm used to enhance the quality of images was proposed. The algorithm consisted of contrast stretching and morphological opening operations. The second step was to characterize the cervical cells to three classes, namely normal, low grade intra-epithelial squamous lesion (LSIL), and high grade intra-epithelial squamous lesion (HSIL). To differentiate between normal and precancerous cells of the cervical cell FE-SEM images, human papillomavirus (HPV) contained in the surface of cells were used as indicators.

We hypothesize that TSHR activation [TSHR*, elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAB), or activating mutation] influences MSC differentiation, which contributes to body composition changes seen in hypothyroidism or Graves' disease (GD). The role of TSHR activation on adipogenesis was first investigated using ex vivo samples. Neck fat (all euthyroid at surgery) was obtained from GD (n = 11, TSAB positive), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG, TSAB negative) (n = 6), and control patients with benign euthyroid disease (n = 11, TSAB negative). The effect of TSHR activation was then analyzed using human primary abdominal subcutaneous preadipocytes (n = 16). Cells were cultured in complete medium (CM) or adipogenic medium [ADM, containing thiazolidinedione (TZD), PPAR. agonist, which is able to induce BAT formation] with or without TSHR activation (gain-of-function mutant) for 3 weeks. Adipogenesis was evaluated using oil red O (ORO), counting adipogenic foci, qPCR measurement of terminal differentiation marker (LPL). BAT [PGC-1 alpha, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and ZIC1], pre-BAT (PRDM16), BRITE-(CITED1), or WAT (LEPTIN) markers were analyzed by semiquantitative PCR or qPCR. In ex vivo analysis, there were no differences in the expression of UCP1, PGC-1a, and ZIC1. BRITE marker CITED1 levels were highest in GD followed by TMNG and control (p for trend = 0.009). This was associated with higher WAT marker LEPTIN level in GD than the other two groups (p < 0.001). In primary cell culture, TSHR activation substantially enhanced adipogenesis with 1.4 +/- 0.07 (ORO), 8.6 +/- 1.8 (foci), and 5.5 +/- 1.6 (LPL) fold increases compared with controls. Surprisingly, TSHR activation in CM also significantly increased pre-BAT marker PRDM16; furthermore, TZD-ADM induced adipogenesis showed substantially increased BAT markers, PGC-1a and UCP1.

Methods: Symptom dimensions were derived from the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History 82 items rated lifetime in acute episodes and stabilized interepisode intervals in 384 patients from the Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Eastern Quebec Kindred Study. Linear mixed effect models of symptom dimensions included rs12630592-rs496250 main and interaction fixed effects (obtained from TaqMan genotypes), and a polygenic random effect. The distribution of lifetime best-estimate DSM-W diagnosis of 855 kindred members was studied versus genotype under a polytomous logistic model. Results: In mood disorder patients, the level of mania (in both acute and stabilized periods) and depression in stabilized periods was positively associated with GSK3B rs12630592 T only in FXR1 rs496250 A-allele carriers (Bonferroni-corrected interaction p=0.024, 0.052 and 0.017 respectively). The two polymorphisms explained 11% of mania variance and 5% of interepisode depression variance. The association was observed neither in schizophrenia patients nor with the psychotic dimension in mood disorder patients.

The differences between the NVAF patients and controls were compared, and the differences and correlations in the LAA parameters between the two imaging techniques were assessed. The NVAF patients had significantly bigger orifice sizes, orifice areas, and maximum volumes, and lower emptying rates. The AF cohort had roughly equal proportions of the four morphological types, whereas the controls predominantly had the windsock type. A Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the LAA measurements obtained using RT3D-TEE were lower than those obtained with the CT.

Surgical outcome is about 50-60% for seizures control, and may also improve mood, cognition, and memory. On this basis, VNS has also been proposed for the treatment of major depression and Alzheimer's' disease. The vagus nerve stimulator must be implanted with blunt technique on the left side to avoid cardiac side effects through the classic approach for anterior cervical discectomy. The actual device is composed of a wire with three helical contacts (two active contacts, one anchoring) and a one-pin battery. VNS is usually started 2 weeks after implantation with recommended settings of stimulation (1.0-2.0mA; 500s pulse width; 20-30Hz; 30s ON, 5min OFF). The complications of VNS therapy are early (related to surgery) and late (related to the device and to stimulation of the vagus nerve). Early complications include the following: intraoperative bradycardia and asystole during lead impedance testing, peritracheal hematoma, infections (3-8%), and vagus nerve injury followed by hoarseness, dyspnea, and dysphagia because of left vocal cord paralysis. Delayed morbidity due to the device includes late infections or problems in wound healing; other more rare events are due to late injury of the nerve. Late complications due to nerve stimulation include delayed arrhythmias, laryngopharyngeal dysfunction (hoarseness, dyspnea, and coughing), obstructive sleep apnea, stimulation of phrenic nerve, tonsillar pain mimicking glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and vocal cord damage during prolonged endotracheal intubation. The laryngopharyngeal dysfunction occurs in about 66% of patients and is usually transitory and due to the stimulation of the inferior (recurrent) laryngeal nerve. A true late paralysis of the left vocal cord is often partial and rare (1-2.7%), and usually transitory, and may be caused by previous surgical trauma (i.e., damage of nerve fibers and/or of their blood supply) or to a supposed chronic denervation during stimulation. Surgery for complete removal or revision and replacement of the device is to be considered in cases of device malfunction (4-16.8%), failure of VNS therapy, intolerable side effects, or because of patient's specific request. As described in the literature, the surgical techniques of lead revision and replacement are two: sharp and blunt dissection of helical electrodes and replacement; and blunt dissection combined with ultrasharp low-voltage cautery dissection. The incidence of left vocal cord palsy after vagus nerve stimulator replacement/revision is slightly higher than that of first implantation (4.9% vs. 3.8%).

Here, we review pathways of proline biosynthesis in the three domains of life. Pathway reconstruction from genome data for hundreds of eubacterial and dozens of archaeal and eukaryotic organisms revealed evolutionary conservation and variations of this pathway across different taxa. In the most prevalent pathway of proline synthesis, glutamate is phosphorylated to -glutamyl phosphate by -glutamyl kinase, reduced to -glutamyl semialdehyde by -glutamyl phosphate reductase, cyclized spontaneously to (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and reduced to proline by (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. In higher plants and animals the first two steps are catalysed by a bi-functional (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. Alternative pathways of proline formation use the initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway to ornithine, which can be converted to (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by ornithine aminotransferase and then reduced to proline or converted directly to proline by ornithine cyclodeaminase. In some organisms, the latter pathways contribute to or could be fully responsible for the synthesis of proline. The conservation of proline biosynthetic enzymes and significance of specific residues for catalytic activity and allosteric regulation are analysed on the basis of protein structural data, multiple sequence alignments, and mutant studies, providing novel insights into proline biosynthesis in organisms.

Our results can be easily extended to other wireless mice using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards. We propose two attacks, the prediction attack and replay attack, which can reconstruct the on-screen cursor trajectories from sniffed mouse movement data. Two inference strategies are used to discover passwords from cursor trajectories. We conducted a holistic study over all popular operating systems and analyzed how mouse acceleration algorithms and packet losses may affect the reconstruction results.

In this study, we investigated the emotional effects and neural correlates of receiving empathic social responses after negative performance feedback and compared the effects of emotionally vs. cognitively empathic comments. 20 participants (10 male) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while receiving negative performance feedback for a cognitive task. Performance feedback was followed by verbal comments either expressing cognitive and emotional empathy or demonstrating a lack of empathy. Empathic comments in general led to less negative self-reported feelings and calmer breathing. At the neural level, empathic comments induced activity in regions associated with social cognition and emotion processing, specifically in right postcentral gyrus and left cerebellum (cognitively empathic comments), right precentral gyrus, the opercular part of left inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus (emotionally empathic comments), as well as the orbital part of the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus (emotionally empathic vs. unempathic comments). The study shows that cognitively and emotionally empathic comments appear to be processed in partially separable neural systems. Furthermore, confirming and expanding on another study on the same subject, the present results demonstrate that the social display of cognitive empathy exerts almost as positive effects on the recipient's feelings and emotions in states of distress as emotionally empathic response does.

To investigate the contribution of BPA exposure levels via the dermal contact route and the relationship between BPA exposure level and oxidative DNA damage, six male volunteers were recruited and required to simulate the cashiers' work and handle the thermal receipts during the study period. Triclosan (TCS, an antimicrobial compound used widely in personal health and skin care products) was applied as a reference compound. Their urinary BPA, TCS and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography/tandem spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). The results showed that after handling the thermal receipts, the urinary BPA concentrations of volunteers increased 3 times of those before the experimental period. But TCS levels in urine kept stable. There existed a correlation between BPA exposure and 8-OHdG (R-2 = 0.237, p < 0.001), but not between TCS and 8-OHdG concentrations (R-2 = 0.026, p < 0.777), indicating that more BPA exposure could lead to higher oxidative DNA damage. That the increases in 8-OHdG levels in urine being almost consistent with those of BPA suggested that handling thermal receipts resulted in the increasing BPA intakes and BPA exposure was correlated with DNA oxidative damage. After 48 h of the end of handling thermal receipts, the urinary BPA levels did not descend to the levels before experiment, suggesting that the excretion of BPA via dermal contact was over 48 h. BPA exposure through dermal contact route contributed 51.9% to 84% to urinary BPA levels with the GMratio of 70.9% for cashiers, indicating that it might be seriously underestimated for cashiers according to the previous studies.

Although NPDs have a dramatic impact on our society because of their high incidence, mortality, and severe debilitating character, remarkably few effective interventions have become available. The current treatments, if available, comprise the lifelong intake of general immunosuppressants to delay disease progression or neurotransmitter antagonists/agonists to dampen undesired behaviors. The long-term usage of such medication, however, coincides with often severe adverse side effects. There is, therefore, an urgent need for safe and effective treatments for these diseases. Here, we discuss that many NPDs coincide with subtle chronic or flaring brain inflammation sometimes escalating with infiltrations of lymphocytes in the inflamed brain parts causing mild to severe or even lethal brain damage. Thus, NPDs show all features of autoimmune diseases. In this review, we postulate that NPDs resemble autoimmune-driven inflammatory diseases in many aspects and may belong to the same disease spectrum. Just like in autoimmune diseases, NPD symptoms basically are manifestations of a chronic self-sustaining inflammatory process with detrimental consequences for the patient. Specific inhibition of the destructive immune responses in the brain, leaving the patient's immune system intact, would be the ultimate solution to cure patients from the disease. To reach this goal, the primary targets, e.g., the primary self-antigens (pSAgs) of the patient's chronic (auto) immune response, need to be identified. For a few major NPDs, immunological studies led to the identification of the pSAgs involved in the autoimmune damage of specific brain parts. However, further research is needed to complete the list of pSAgs for all NPDs. Such immunological studies will not only provide crucial insights into NPD pathogenesis but also ultimately enable the development of a new generation of safe and effective immunotherapies for NPDs.

For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A common paradigm in tensor-related algorithms advocates unfolding (or flattening) the tensor into a matrix and applying classical methods developed for matrices. Despite the popularity of such techniques, how the functional properties of a tensor changes upon unfolding is currently not well understood. In contrast to the body of existing work which has focused almost exclusively on matricizations, we here consider all possible unfoldings of an order-k tensor, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of partitions of {1,, k}. We derive general inequalities between the l(P)-norms of arbitrary unfoldings defined on the partition lattice. In particular, we demonstrate how the spectral norm (p = 2) of a tensor is bounded by that of its unfoldings, and obtain an improved upper bound on the ratio of the Frobenius norm to the spectral norm of an arbitrary tensor. For specially-structured tensors satisfying a generalized definition of orthogonal decomposability, we prove that the spectral norm remains invariant under specific subsets of unfolding operations.

We have reported that varenicline aggravates formation of atherosclerotic plaques through alpha(7) nAChR in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. However, little is known about its effects on macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we ascertained whether varenicline promotes oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake in mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro and clarified its mechanism. We investigated the effects of varenicline (1-10,mu M) on expression of scavenger receptors (lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), cluster of differentiation (CD) 36 and scavenger receptor class A (SR-A)) in RAW264.7 cells. Expression of protein and mRNA was determined by western blotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction, respectively. Effects of varenicline (10 mu M) on oxLDL uptake were examined by counting the number of macrophages stained with oil red 0 and hematoxylin. Varenicline significantly increased expression of the protein and mRNA of LOX -1 and CD36, but not SR-A, in RAW264.7 cells, and increased oxLDL uptake in macrophages. These effects of varenicline were blocked significantly by an alpha 7 nAChR antagonist, methyllycaconitine (MLA) (50 nM), but not by an alpha(4)beta(2) nAChR antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine hydrobromide (DH beta E) (1 AA). These data suggest that varenicline promotes oxLDL uptake by upregulating expression of LOX -1 and CD36 through alpha(7) nAChR in macrophages. We found that varenicline significantly activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. This activation was blocked by MLA but not DH beta E. Therefore, ERK1/2-NF-kappa B signaling pathway is highly likely to be responsible for varenicline-induced upregulation of LOX-1 and CD36 expression through a(7) nAChR in macrophages. These processes probably contribute to varenicline-aggravated atherosclerotic plaque formation.

To help better prepare the trainees at the National Institutes of Health for possible careers in translation, we have created the Translational Science Training Program (TSTP). The TSTP is an intensive 2- to 3-day training program that introduces NIH postdoctoral trainees and graduate students to the science and operation of turning basic research discoveries into a medical therapeutic, device or diagnostic, and also exposes them to the variety of career options in translational science. Through a combination of classroom teaching from practicing experts in the various disciplines of translation and small group interactions with pre-clinical development teams, participants in the TSTP gain knowledge that will aid them in obtaining a career in translational science and building a network to make the transition to the field.

We performed this study to find the characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for discrimination from healthy subjects. Methods VOCs in the exhaled breath of 40 IPF patients and 55 healthy controls were measured using a multi-capillary column and ion mobility spectrometer. The patients were examined by pulmonary function tests, blood gas analysis, and serum biomarkers of interstitial pneumonia. Results We detected 85 VOC peaks in the exhaled breath of IPF patients and controls. IPF patients showed 5 significant VOC peaks; p-cymene, acetoin, isoprene, ethylbenzene, and an unknown compound. The VOC peak of p-cymene was significantly lower (p < 0.001), while the VOC peaks of acetoin, isoprene, ethylbenzene, and the unknown compound were significantly higher (p < 0.001 for all) compared with the peaks of controls. Comparing VOC peaks with clinical parameters, negative correlations with VC (r =-0.393, p = 0.013), %VC (r =-0.569, p < 0.001), FVC (r = -0.440, p = 0.004), %FVC (r =-0.539, p < 0.001), DLco (r =-0.394, p = 0.018), and %DLco (r =-0.413, p = 0.008) and a positive correlation with KL-6 (r = 0.432, p = 0.005) were found for p-cymene.

In addition to both invasive (muscle biopsy) and noninvasive methods, techniques to assess other lipids within muscle will be reviewed. Recent findings In addition to intramuscular triglycerides, other lipids contained within skeletal muscle such as diacylglycerol and ceramides may have an important role in human metabolic disease. Both ex-vivo and in-vivo methods to obtain serial measurements of these muscle lipids as a result of experimental perturbation have recently provided unique insight into their respective roles in human metabolism. Summary Triglyceride accumulation within skeletal muscle has received considerable interest due to its potential role in insulin resistance and fatty acid metabolism of obesity, aging and type 2 diabetes. Observations that triglycerides themselves may be used as a fuel source for exercising muscle, and thus may not be detrimental in all circumstances, has in part prompted the development and implementation of analytical methods to quantify the fatty acid composition of muscle triglycerides as well as other lipid species within muscle, e.g. diacylglycerol and ceramides. In addition, noninvasive computed tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging methods have been applied to examine the serial effects of intervention on muscle triglycerides.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 30104, "input": "Recently, fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controllers are demonstrated as a general form of the classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) using fractional calculus. In FOPID controller, the orders of the derivative and integral portions are not integers which offer more flexibility in succeeding control objectives. This paper proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to optimize the FOPID controller gains to enhance the ride comfort of heavy vehicles. The usage of magnetorheological (MR) damper in seat suspension system provides considerable benefits in this area. The proposed semi-active control algorithm consists of a system controller that determines the desired damping force using a FOPID controller tuned using a MOGA, and a continuous state damper controller that calculates the input voltage to the damper coil. A mathematical model of a six degrees-of-freedom seat suspension system incorporating human body model using an MR damper is derived and simulated using Matlab/Simulink software. The proposed semi-active MR seat suspension is compared to the classical PID, optimum PID tuned using genetic algorithm (GA) and passive seat suspension systems for predetermined chassis displacement. System performance criteria are examined in both time and frequency domains, in order to verify the success of the proposed FOPID algorithm.

To date, however, the You're Welcome' criteria have not been considered within community pharmacy service development policy. The aim of this article was to assess the relevance of the You're Welcome' criteria to community pharmacy, and examine ways in which they are currently met, or not met, to guide future service development. MethodsThe project employed three methods. Checklist-guided observations and face-to-face semistructured interviews with staff members were undertaken in eight community pharmacies across England and Scotland, purposively selected because of their known focus on provision of young people's services. This was complemented by a cross-sectional online survey for completion by pharmacy staff across a wider range of pharmacies recruited through targeted Local Pharmaceutical Committees (LPC). Study instruments were designed to gather information relevant to each of the You're Welcome' criteria. Key findingsEight pharmacies took part in observations and interviews. Six LPCs posted the online survey link on their website, which was returned by 56 respondents. The results demonstrate applicability of the You're Welcome' criteria to community pharmacy services, highlighting particular strengths of community pharmacy services for young people (e.g. accessibility) as well as opportunities and priorities for service development to meet their specific needs (e.g. staff training, engagement and integration with local service provision). ConclusionsThe You're Welcome' criteria can be applied to community pharmacy services without adaptation providing an appropriate framework to guide service development to promote young people friendly pharmacy services.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 16468, "input": "Impairments in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system during diabetes mellitus, leading to its dysfunction, have been known since a decade. Hyperglycemia induces several pathological alterations which upregulate this system, accounting for overexpression of its downstream signaling molecules, amongst which angiotensin II (Ang 11) and aldosterone hold prime pathological notoriety. Although it is well known that elevated plasma levels of Ang II play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of type-II diabetic mellitus, by inducing and aggravating insulin resistance, it is not quite much known that it equally elevates the possibility/risk of development of diabetic complications. Also, amongst the various diabetic complications, the effects of Ang II upregulation are more widely acknowledged in studies concerning the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, its role in exacerbating diabetic retinopathy has not received much attention. Ang II, indeed, plays a detrimental role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy by augmenting the principal events involved in its pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, angiogenesis and inflammation. The utility of angiotensin receptor blockers has shown positive results in research studies and hence, might potentially provide a novel adjuvant therapy for treating this complication and preventing the associated vision-loss in diabetic patients.

As visual dysfunction is one of the most common manifestations of MS, sensitive visual outcome measures are important in examining the effect of treatment. Low-contrast acuity captures visual loss not seen in high-contrast visual acuity (HCVA) measurements. These issues are addressed by the MS Outcome Assessments Consortium (MSOAC), including representatives from advocacy organizations, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), academic institutions, and industry partners along with persons living with MS. MSOAC goals are acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful to persons with MS. A critical step is elucidation of clinically relevant benchmarks, well-defined degrees of disability, and gradients of change that are clinically meaningful. This review shows that MS and disease-free controls have similar median HCVA, while MS patients have significantly lower LCLA. Deficits in LCLA and vision-specific quality of life are found many years after an episode of acute optic neuritis, even when HCVA has recovered.

Called the Global Plasmasphere lonosphere Density (GPID) model, its aim is to reproduce the main dynamic features of the more complete Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) model, with a simpler formulation that allows for more rapid computation of the ions temporal variation in a magnetic flux tube. By simultaneously modelling several thousand flux tubes, a global representation of the plasmasphere can be obtained in a realistic time frame. A global model allows the plasmaspheric contribution to the Total Electron Content (TEC), measured from Global Position System (GPS) satellite radio signals, to be determined and removed, hence permitting the underlying ionosphere to be observed. This paper presents the approach used to model a single magnetic flux tube. GPID assumes an lonosphere/plasmasphere composition of O+ and H+, and includes chemical processes and simple diffusive transport. In almost all situations, GPID reproduces the predictions of the FLIP model. Comparisons between GPID and the refilling fluxes obtained from whistler observations generally show good agreement, both in diurnal variations and during prolonged refilling of empty flux tubes.

New antifungals and new therapeutic strategies are needed to address this challenge. We previously reported that the combination of a synthetic compound with a drug with known mechanism of action is a good strategy to treat aggressive and resistant fungi. Here we revisited our approach and synthesized structural analogues of flucytosine, which is a synthetic antifungal and is being studied for its use in combination therapy with other antifungal drugs. Pyrimidin-one and thione (often known as DHPM ' s) as flucytosine analogues were obtained through a Biginelli reaction of corresponding aldehydes, ethylacetoacetate and urea/thiourea. Structure was confirmed by FTIR, 1HNMR, (CNMR)-C-13, COSY and MS (ESI+) analysis. All the newly synthesized derivatives were evaluated for the antifungal activity alone and in combination of two most commonly used antifungal drugs, amphotericin B and fluconazole against different clinically isolated Candida albicans strains. Minimum inhibitory concentration results confirmed that BG4 possess high antifungal activity against all the tested strains (MIC = 1-32 pg/ml). For all the combinations with amphotericin B and fluconazole, 37% were synergistic followed by 30% additive and 24% indifferent interactions. Interestingly, 9% antagonistic interaction was observed when BG1 and BG3 were combined with fluconazole, however, no antagonistic interaction was observed with amphotericin B. In-depth studies of all the synergies were done by constructing isobolograms with nine different ratio combinations. These results warrant the use of DHPM derivatives as chemosensitising agents which could lower down the dosages of the antifungal drugs to treat invasive fungal diseases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Chronic uterine inflammation is a known cause of implantation failure and is associated with high matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in uterine cavity flushing. MMP activity of women with RIF has been reported to be higher than that of fertile women. In the present retrospective study we evaluated the efficacy of treatment for high MMP activity in the uterine cavity of patients with RIF. Methods: Of the 597 patients recruited to the study, 360 patients underwent MMP measurements and 237 patients did not (control group). All patients had failed to become pregnant, despite at least two transfers of good-quality embryos. Gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in uterine flushing fluid was detected by enzymology (MMP test). All samples were classified into two groups (positive or negative) based on the intensity of the bands on the enzyme zymogram, which represents the degree of MMP activity. Patients who tested positive on the initial test were treated for 2 weeks with a quinolone antibiotic and a corticosteroid, and subsequently underwent a second MMP test. Negative results on the second MMP tests after treatment and subsequent rates of pregnancy and miscarriage were used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. Data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U-test and the chi-square test. Results: Of the patients who underwent the MMP test, 15.6% had positive results (high MMP activity). After treatment, 89.3% of patients had negative results on the second MMP test. These patients had a significantly better pregnancy rate (42.0%) than the control group (26.6%), as well as a lower miscarriage rate (28.5% vs 36.5%, respectively).

In order for PEM fuel cells to increase the endurance of an in-service battery power supply, without decreasing the peak power, it should be hybridised with a battery. It is key for the market that the overall switch to hybrid technology is low cost in terms of size, weight and money. Hybrid technology tends to be generically designed to suit any power system, using regulators to ensure voltage matching, and diodes to control the direction of electrical flow. Many electric motors are controlled by speed controllers which can regulate the thrust provided by the motor, accounting for fluctuations in voltage usually found in a depleting battery. Using diode and regulator based hybrids for electric motor applications is therefore inherently inefficient even if complicated synchronous DC DC converters are used due to the increased cost, size and weight. This paper demonstrates the ability to use ideal diodes to control the flow of electricity through the hybrid and that voltage regulation is not needed for a motor in this case. Furthermore, this paper explores the natural balancing strategy created by duty cycling the PEM fuel cell to different points within it's polarisation curve, removing the requirement for DC DC converters to match it to the battery voltage.

In study B, a 1,000 mg single dose was given, and samples were taken for 48 h postdose. Pharmacokinetics of mesalazine and N-acetylmesalazine (LC-MS/MS) were calculated by noncompartmental methods. NAT2 phenotype could be allocated unequivocally in 21 slow and 5 rapid acetylators in study A, and in 9 slow and 8 rapid acetylators in study B. Geometric mean (CV%) values in study A for slow [rapid] acetylators were as follows: mesalazine AUC 11.1 A mu g/mL center dot h (51%) [12.0 A mu g/mL center dot h (52%)], N-acetylmesalazine AUC 27.7 A mu g/mL center dot h (32%) [30.5 A mu g/mL center dot h (27%)], mesalazine Ae 8.53% (89%) [9.03% (52%)], N-acetylmesalazine Ae 31.4% (46%) [32.2 (41%)]. Values in study B were as follows: mesalazine AUC 3.45 A mu g/mL center dot h (113%) [2.36 A mu g/mL center dot h (87%)], N-acetylmesalazine AUC 21.3 A mu g/mL center dot h (29%) [18.0 A mu g/mL center dot h (39%)], mesalazine Ae 0.2% (256%) [0.1% (359%)], N-acetylmesalazine Ae 30.9% (44%) [18.1% (84%)]. Higher AUC and Ae values for mesalazine in steady state study indicate saturation of mesalazine metabolism. Statistics provided no evidence for a true difference in mesalazine pharmacokinetics between slow and rapid acetylators, and no significant correlation between NAT2 activity and any mesalazine pharmacokinetic parameter was found.

Its deleterious effects on human liver encompass a lot of physiological, genetic as well as epigenetic alterations. Fatty liver (Hepatic steatosis) is an inflammation having multifactorial ancestries; one of them is HCV (steatohepatitis). HCV boosts several cellular pathways involving up-regulation of a number of cytokines. Current study reviews the regulation of some selective key cytokines during HCV infection, to help generate an improved understanding of their role. These cytokines, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-I', are inflammatory markers of the body. These particular markers along with others help hepatocytes against viral infestation. However, recently, their association has been found in degradation of liver on the trail heading to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Consequently, the disturbance in their equilibrium has been repeatedly reported during HCV infection. Quite a number of findings are affirming their up-regulation. Although these cell markers are stimulated by hepatocytes as their standard protection mechanism, but modern studies have testified the paradoxical nature of this defense line. Nevertheless, direct molecular or epigenetic research is needed to question the actual molecular progressions and directions commanding liver to steatosis, cirrhosis, or eventually HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma).", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 34522, "input": "The development of methods for the detection of aflatoxin BI (AFB(1)) in foods is a very important practice for ensuring food quality and safety.

Recent findings The aggregated evidence indicates a consistent detrimental effect of prenatal exposure to parental smoking, outdoor air pollution, and maternal stress on childhood wheezing illnesses. Less consistent evidence suggests an adverse impact of maternal obesity during pregnancy and prenatal exposure to antibiotics on these outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to support an association between in-utero exposure to acetaminophen or prenatal levels of specific nutrients (such as vitamin D, folic acid, or polyunsaturated fatty acids) and childhood wheezing illnesses. Summary Several common potentially modifiable prenatal exposures appear to be consistently associated with childhood wheezing illnesses (e.g. parental smoking, outdoor air pollution, and maternal stress). However, the effect of many other prenatal exposures on the onset of childhood wheezing illnesses remains unclear.

We conducted a probability-based phone survey of 1164 U.S. adult cigarette smokers in 2014-2015 and analyzed results in 2016. In a between-subjects experiment, smokers heard a hypothetical scenario in which cigarettes and e-cigarettes had the same amount of harmful chemicals or cigarettes had more chemicals than e-cigarettes (10x more, 100x more, or chemicals were present only in cigarettes). Smokers indicated how the scenario would change their interest in dual use and perceived health harms. Few smokers (7%) who heard that the products have the same amount of chemicals were interested in initiating or increasing dual use. However, more smokers were interested when told that cigarettes have 10x more chemicals than e-cigarettes (31%), 100x more chemicals than e-cigarettes (32%), or chemicals were present only in cigarettes (43%) (all p < .001). Individuals told that cigarettes have more chemicals were more likely than those in the \"same amount\" scenario to perceive that cigarettes would be more harmful than e-cigarettes (79% vs. 41%, OR = 5.41, 95% CI = 4.08-7.17). These harm perceptions partially explained the relationship between chemical scenario and dual use interest. Smokers associated higher chemical amounts in cigarettes versus e-cigarettes with greater health harms from cigarettes and thus expressed increased interest in dual use. The findings suggest that disclosing amounts of chemicals in cigarette smoke and e-cigarette aerosol could unintentionally encourage dual use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Also, epidemiologic studies failed to indicate an elevated bladder cancer risk in humans occupationally exposed to PBNA. The amounts of 2-naphthylamine found in the urine of different species including humans after exposure to PBNA indicate unequivocally that PBNA is dephenylated to some extent. These are not explained by the 2-naphthylamine impurities in technical-grade PBNA. To explain the metabolic dephenylation process, it has been suggested that PBNA is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes to the phenolic derivative 4'-hydroxy-N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, followed by its further oxidation to the quinone imine, which subsequently hydrolyses to form the dephenylation product 2-naphthylamine. Phenolic metabolites from the initial CYP-mediated activation step are rapidly conjugated. Quantitatively, dephenylation of PBNA to 2-naphthylamine is a minor pathway. The dog represents an animal model that appears to approximate the human metabolism and biological activation of PBNA. Based on published data, a worst-case scenario indicates that about 1% of total PBNA taken up is transferred into 2-naphthylamine. However, in vitro as well as in vivo findings with PBNA may point to a significantly smaller conversion rate, as metabolites anticipated from the metabolism of 2-naphthylamine were not detected so far.

Among the existing approaches, BING [1] (binarized normed gradients) is the recently proposed one that possesses the advantages of high object detection rate, ultra fast computational speed (i.e. 300 fps), small number of proposals, and good generalization ability. However, within BING's framework, only the uniform hierarchical ranking structure and gradient information are employed for objectness characterization, which leads to high false positive rate. To address this issue, an effective and efficient cascade ranking method is proposed to refine BING, in this paper. It declares three main contributions. First, the concept of scale-sets histogram is novelly introduced. It helps to analyze the potential sizes of the objects. Secondly, more descriptive visual features (i.e. the color-texture consistence) are considered simultaneously for objectness characterization. Lastly, we propose hierarchical sorting to further leverage the ranking performance, according to the local contrast analysis between the inside and straddling superpixels of the object proposal windows. The experimental results on four challenging datasets PASCAL VOC2007, PASCAL VOC2010, PASCAL VOC2012 and ILSVRC2014 demonstrate that, the refined BING can achieve good balance between high detection rate (DR) (e.g. 96.7% DR with 1000 proposal windows on VOC2007), and low time consumption (e.g. 75 ms per image on VOC2007). It is also worth noting that, with a relatively small number of proposals (e.g. fewer than 200 proposals), our approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the detection rate, on all the testing datasets.

The objective was to determine which observational pain assessment tool was the most appropriate for the emergency department context and the cognitively impaired older person. Background. The number of older people with cognitive impairment conditions, such as dementia, presenting to the emergency department is increasing. Approximately 28% of people over 65 years who present will have cognitive impairment. Older people with cognitive impairment often receive suboptimal pain management in the ED. There is limited evidence of the use and/or appropriateness of dementia-specific pain observation assessment tools in the ED. Design. This was a multicentre exploratory qualitative study, which was conducted within a constructivist paradigm. Methods. Focus group interviews were conducted with nurses across three hospital emergency departments. Data were subject to thematic analysis. Results. Six focus groups were conducted with 36 nurses over a 12-week period. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) cognitive impairment is a barrier to pain management; 2) PAINAD gives structure to pain assessment; 3) PAINAD assists to convey pain intensity; and 4) selection of an appropriate observational pain assessment tool. Conclusions. This study identified that emergency nurses find it challenging to detect, assess and manage pain in cognitively impaired people. While the use of the PAINAD helped to address these challenges compared to other tools, nurses also identified the important role that family and carers can play in pain assessment and management for older people with cognitive impairment.

An increase in beta oscillations (12-35 Hz) within the basal ganglia (BG) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e. the lower beta (12-20 Hz) and upper beta (21-35 Hz). A computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations. Simulation results show several findings. The upper beta frequency in the BG originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the BG depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). There is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the GPe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations. It is shown that increased self-inhibition within the GPe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the GPe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the BG.

Methods: The study included 5276 participants (70% female) of the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study aged 20 or above who had total 25(OH)D measured. Three-phase segmented regression was used to identify the optimal break-point between 25(OH)D and PTH.

Using unadjusted three-phase segmented regression, the estimated first and second break-point of 25(OH)D on PTH suppression were 32 nmol/L (95% CI: 29-35) and 89 nmol/L (95% CI: 77-101) with an r(2) of 0.048, whereas the estimated first and second break-point of 25(OH)D were 27 nmol/L (95% Cl: 24-30) and 47 nmol/L (95% CI: 37-56) after adjusting for factors affecting bone and mineral metabolism. In addition, the relationship between 25(OH)D and PTH significantly differed by sex and age. Conclusion: The threshold for 250HD at the point of maximal suppression of PTH estimated in this study was lower than the suggested threshold of vitamin D deficiency in the literature, perhaps due to race or assay differences, and the relationship between vitamin D and PTH changed with sex and age.

However, the flexible nature of the mobile device is a critical challenge for the mobile cloud computing environment. The mobile phone significantly degrades the data transfer performance when initiating the handover process. Thus, an energy-efficient handover process could improve the quality of service (QoS). Here, we introduce a secure energy-efficient and quality-of-service architecture (EEQoSA) for the handover process in the mobile cloud computing environment. The proposed architecture involves four layers: application, the Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IPMS), communication, and media with connectivity layers. These four layers collectively handle the energy-efficiency, security and QoS parameters. Existing service-oriented architectures designed for mobile cloud computing are based on the symmetric encryption cryptography to support different media services. However, this approach easily allows an adversary to expose the symmetric key and gain access to private data. Thus, our proposed architecture uses the secure and strong authentication (SSA) process at the IPMS layer by protecting the media services from unauthorized users, as the IPMS is the central layer that could be the entry point for an adversary. Furthermore, to extend the mobile lifetime during the handover process, an energy detection (ED) model is deployed at the communication layer to detect the energy level of the mobile device prior to the handover initialization process. The media with the connectivity layer supports the secure handover process using a priority enforcement module that allows only legitimate users to complete the re-registration process after initiating the handover. Finally, the architecture is tested using the CloudSim simulation environment and validated by a comparison with other known service-oriented architectures.", "class": "Computer Science"}, {"id": 32108, "input": "Sports injuries have increased today due to the rise in interest towards every branch of sports.

Early diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 17-year-old male who presented with a history of sudden-onset, postural headaches associated with upper thoracic back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a thoracic extradural fluid collection and slumping of the brain within the posterior fossa. The patient was initially managed with a period of bed rest, followed by a thoracic epidural blood patch. Symptoms recurred and subsequent operative exploration found a large arachnoid cyst with CSF egress through a linear split in the axilla of the right T7 nerve root. The arachnoid cyst was resected, and the defect was closed primarily. All symptoms completely resolved. MRI at 3 months postoperatively demonstrated normal spinal configuration and resolution of brain sagging. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous CSF leaks are a rare cause of postural headache.

Bacteria have evolved different strategies to manipulate their host metabolism for their own benefit. This bacterial manipulation is often coupled with severe symptom development or the death of the affected plants. Determining the specific bacterial molecules responsible for the host manipulation has become an important field in microbiological research. After the identification of these bacterial molecules, called \"effectors,\" it is important to elucidate their function. A straightforward approach to determine the function of an effector is to identify its proteinaceous binding partner in its natural host via a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen. Normally the host harbors numerous potential binding partners that cannot be predicted sufficiently by any in silico algorithm. It is thus the best choice to perform a screen with the hypothetical effector against a whole library of expressed host proteins. It is especially challenging if the causative agent is uncultivable like phytoplasma. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions for DNA purification from a phytoplasma-infected woody host plant, the amplification of the potential effector, and the subsequent identification of the plant's molecular interaction partner with a Y2H screen. Even though Y2H screens are commonly used, there is a trend to outsource this technique to biotech companies that offer the Y2H service at a cost.

The mechanisms that contribute to the relationship between disease activity and depressive symptoms are not clearly investigated yet. Since emotion regulation has been considered particularly relevant to define the impact of adverse experiences on different outcomes, the current study aimed to examine the longitudinal influence of two maladaptive emotion regulation processes, cognitive fusion and brooding, on the association between disease activity and depressed mood. This study was conducted over an 18-month period, using a sample of 116 IBD patients that completed self-report validated measures in three different waves. Correlation analyses and cross-lagged panel models were performed. The main result from this study discovered that the experience of IBD symptomatology at baseline, although positively linked to the manifestation of depressed mood 18 months later (r = 0.25; p < 0.01), does not directly predict depressive symptoms. This relationship is rather indirect, as it is explained by the engagement in cognitive fusion (p = 0.028) and brooding (p = 0.017). These maladaptive emotion regulation processes, that were revealed to be consistent over time, link IBD symptoms with subsequent depressed mood.

Studies have shown caregivers of individuals with ED to experience high levels of distress, burden and expressed emotion. Recent theoretical models have underscored the importance of caregivers' responses as a maintenance factor for the ED, and family therapy has proved efficacious. However, the literature pertaining to the experience of family members living with or caring for an individual with an ED has not been systematically reviewed. This review aimed to synthesize qualitative studies relating to the caring experience and its impact, thereby gaining an understanding from the perspective of the individuals themselves. Relevant search terms were utilized to systematically search key databases. Twenty studies, with a total sample of 239 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Nine core themes emerged from the synthesis, forming the basis of an explanatory theory. The ED was found to have a pervasive impact upon family members, mediated by a number of factors. Cognitive appraisals affected the caregiving experience and responses to the individual. The experience of caregiving was continually reappraised leading to a process of adaptation.

Nonparametric system identification was then applied to measured CSP and AP to establish a second-order nonlinear Uryson model. The aim in this study was to assess the importance of higher-order nonlinear dynamics via development and evaluation of a third-order nonlinear model of the total arc using the same experimental data. Third-order Volterra and Uryson models were developed by employing nonparametric and parametric identification methods. The R-2 values between the AP predicted by the best third-order Volterra model and measured AP in response to Gaussian white noise CSP not utilized in developing the model were 0.69 +/- 0.03 and 0.70 +/- 0.03 for normotensive and hypertensive rats, respectively. The analogous R-2 values for the best third-order Uryson model were 0.71 +/- 0.03 and 0.73 +/- 0.03. These R-2 values were not statistically different from the corresponding values for the previously established second-order Uryson model, which were both 0.71 +/- 0.03 (P >0.1). Furthermore, none of the third-order models predicted well-known nonlinear behaviors including thresholding and saturation better than the second-order Uryson model.

Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on outpatients with psoriatic arthritis. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F; version 4) was used to measure fatigue; 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) to measure quality of life; Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) to assess functional capacity; Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale to measure anxiety and depression symptoms; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) to evaluate clinical activity.

For instance, the operational taxonomic unit Babesia sp. Xinjiang (abbreviated here as Bx) of sheep from China is substantially less virulent/pathogenic than B. bovis is in cattle.

It is worth noting that there is no direct contact between the saline water and the PCM, therefore, the solar energy is not directly stored in the PCM. In the evening, the energy stored in the PCM is transferred as heat to the saline water by heat pipes and enables the desalination process to continue. Several tests were run to investigate the performance of the system. The results revealed that the presence of an external condenser filled with PCM and equipped with heat pipes in a solar still with evacuated tube collectors, makes the desalination process continue after the sunset without causing a decrease in the yield during the daytime.

Four three-dimensional finite element models were simulated under masticatory force and maximum bite force: vertical (axial), angular (45 degrees) and horizontal loads of 280 N at 5 points; vertical load of 700 N at 8 points were loaded, respectively. The stress distribution varied with the different cement thicknesses and directions of applied loads. The monolithic zirconia crowns with cement thicknesses exceeding 200 mu m had wider distributions of peak maximum principal stress under the same loading conditions. Monolithic zirconia crowns have more stress concentrations on the occlusal surfaces, while the cement layers have more stress concentrations on the cervical areas.

Research efforts have mainly focused on alterations in monoaminergic neurotransmission, especially in relation to the serotonergic system, due to its key role in the regulation of mood and related biological functions. Given the high heritability of MD (estimated between 31% and 42% for unipolar depression), genes coding for key regulators of the serotonergic neurotransmission have been considered as optimal candidates. The present review is focused on the role of genes coding for serotonin receptors in MD pathogenesis, since the serotonin transporter and enzymes involved in serotonin metabolism have been reviewed elsewhere. Despite the large number of candidate gene studies focusing on genes coding for serotonin receptors, results have been inconsistent. The most replicated findings are the associations between rs6295 (HTR1A gene) G allele or G/G genotype and rs6311 (HTR2A gene) A allele or A/A genotype and MD or depressive symptoms. Preclinical and imaging/post-mortem studies in humans provide strong support for the involvement of HTR1A and HTR2A genes in MD. Nevertheless, the inconsistency across previous studies clearly suggests that innovative approaches should be designed in order to overcome the limitations of candidate gene studies. To date, the most appealing methodologies seem to be full exome or genome sequencing, genome-wide pathway analyses, endophenotypes, and epigenetic biomarkers. The reported tools may assist in the detection of multiple-loci models, which could potentially explain the high percentage of MD susceptibility ascribed to genetic factors.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 35471, "input": "The high-power grid-connected inverters with LCL filters have been widely used. Current control plays a key role in the grid-connected inverter control system. To cope with the inherent resonance of the LCL filter, active damping (AD) methods are usually employed. However, the AD performance is impaired by control delays which are introduced in the digital control implementation process. Besides, the lag phase due to control delays limits the system bandwidth and stability margin. The effects of control delays are more noteworthy in the high-power grid-connected inverter due to its low switching frequency. This paper investigates the current control strategy based on multisampling for the high-power grid-connected inverter with the LCL filter. First, the multisampled AD scheme is studied, which can reduce control delays effectively and improve AD performance. Besides, the multisampled control without additional damping whether passive or active is researched. Through the inverter-side current feedback, the system can realize single-current-loop control based on multisampling. Thus, the control system is simplified and it can be stable, and achieve better dynamic performance. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed control schemes are effective.", "class": "Electrical Engineering"}, {"id": 7854, "input": "Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic conditions not only fundamentally affect patients' quality of life and physiological needs but are also negatively associated with work ability. The costs of poor work ability, which, in sum, are more than treatment costs, pose an economic burden to society and patients. Work ability in RA appears to be multifactorial; symptoms such as pain, swelling, and stiffness play a major role, as these directly affect functional disability. Also, RA patients typically suffer from reduced muscle strength. Lower extremity function and grip strengths especially impair their quality of life. However, the role of muscle strength and disease activity as determinants of work ability have not yet been studied. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare work ability in working-age participants with seropositive RA and with high and low disease activity; the secondary objective is to evaluate the association of muscle strength, functional ability, and frailty with work ability. Methods: This monocentric cross-sectional study will be conducted at a rheumatologic outpatient clinic and day hospital with approximately 100 seropositive RA patients aged <65 years. A clinical disease activity index as a measure for rheumatoid disease activity will be assessed during the patients' routine visits at the clinic. Work ability, frailty, and functional disability will be evaluated with (self-reported) questionnaires as well as with physical tests (Work Ability Index/Score; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index; Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument; Short Physical Performance Battery). Muscle strength will be determined with dynamometer measurements of isometric hand grip strength and quadriceps femoris muscle contraction strength. Sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale) and sexual functioning as physiological needs will additionally be determined with self-reported questionnaires. Results: For this study funding has already been awarded and enrollment has been completed. Data are currently being evaluated. Conclusions: This study will evaluate the association of work ability with modifiable parameters such as muscle strength and functional ability. It will provide further insights into work ability in RA and its associated risk factors. Any evidence of association will motivate further research, and the findings might encourage interventions focused specifically on improving muscle strength and lower extremity function to positively affect work ability.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 33672, "input": "The article introduced the system structure and imaging principle of no three-dimensional imaging laser radar.

Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements.

Among different compounds, zonisamide has been used to address unmet needs of standard pharmacotherapy. The purpose of the present article is to provide a review about the use of zonisamide for the treatment of psychiatric conditions. Methods: A research in the main database sources has been conducted to obtain an overview of the use of zonisamide in psychiatric disorders or associated conditions (obesity and smoking cessation). Results: Most available data indicate the possible effectiveness of zonisamide for the treatment of acute phases of bipolar disorder, binge-eating disorder (BED), alcohol misuse, and obesity. A further assessment of the safety and tolerability of zonisamide is made necessary by the fact that, with the exception of BED, for all other disorders at least some data come from studies with combined pharmacological therapies. Conclusions: Zonisamidemay have some utility, especially as an adjunctive therapy, for the management of acute phases and weight gain in bipolar disorder and for prevention of alcohol misuse.

Here we focus on the 2015 test of the presently last IC of the series, the central solenoid (CS) insert coil, which was aimed at confirming the performance and properties of the Nb3Sn conductor, manufactured in Japan and used to wind the ITER CS modules in the US. As typical for these large scale applications, the cooldown (CD) from ambient to supercritical He temperature may take a long time, of the order of several weeks, so that it should be useful, also in the perspective of future IC tests, to optimize it. To that purpose, a comprehensive CD model implemented in the 4C code is developed and presented in this paper. The model is validated against the experimental data of an actual CD scenario, showing a very good agreement between simulation and measurements, from 300 to 4.5 K. The maximum temperature difference across the coil, which can only be roughly estimated from the measurements, is then extracted from the results of the simulation and shown to be much larger than the maximum value of 50 K, prescribed on the basis of the allowable thermal stress on the materials. An optimized CD scenario is finally designed using the model for the initial phase of the CD between 300 and 80 K, which allows reducing the needed time by similar to 20%, while still satisfying the major constraints.

However, prior studies have sometimes failed to find differences between patients and controls for more difficult tasks. We pursued the hypothesis that overconfidence in errors is exaggerated in participants with a liability to psychosis relative to controls only when they feel competent in the respective topic and/or deem the question easy. Whereas subjective competence likely enhances confidence in those with low psychosis liability as well, we still expected to find more 'residual' caution in the latter group. Methods: We adopted a psychometric high-risk approach to circumvent the confounding influence of treatment. A total of 2321 individuals from the general population were administered a task modeled after the \"Who wants to be a millionaire\" quiz. Participants were requested to endorse one out of four response options, graded for confidence, and were asked to provide ratings regarding subjective competence for the knowledge domain as well as the subjective difficulty of each item. Results: In line with our assumption, overconfidence in errors was increased overall in participants scoring high on the Paranoia Checklist core paranoia subscale (2 SD above the mean). This pattern of results was particularly prominent for items for which participants considered themselves competent and which they rated as easy. Limitations: Results need to be replicated in a clinical sample. Discussion: In support of our hypothesis, subjective competence and task difficulty moderate overconfidence in errors in psychosis.

We developed and tested a novel intervention, multicomponent behavioral treatment and exercise therapy (M-BET), that may reduce nocturia and improve sleep in men. We compared reductions in nocturia and improvement in sleep in men with M-BET versus an active drug comparator (alpha-blocker) used alone or in combination (M-BET + alpha-blocker) Methods: This randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the ambulatory setting in 2 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers in men at least 40 years of age with nocturia (defined as >= 2 nightly episodes). Participants were randomized to receive either M-BET, including pelvic floor muscle training, urge-suppression techniques, delayed voiding, fluid management, sleep hygiene, and peripheral edema management; an active comparator of known efficacy (the alpha-blocker tamsulosin, one 0.4-mg tablet nightly); or both therapies combined. Participants received interventions over 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed via voiding diaries, wrist actigraphy, and validated questionnaires. The primary outcome was change in diary-recorded nocturia, assessed using ANCOVA for the between-group changes and paired t tests for within-group changes. Findings: A total of 72 men with a mean age of 65.8 years participated. At 12 weeks, mean diary recorded nocturia changed with M-BET by 1.39 episodes/night (P < 0.001), with alpha-blocker therapy by -0.59 episodes/night (P < 0.01), and with combination therapy by -1.03 episodes/night (P < 0.01). Reductions were not statistically different across treatment groups (P = 0.41). M-BET also showed statistically significant improvements in sleep quality, bother from nocturia, and nocturia-specific quality of life. All treatment groups indicated global satisfaction with treatment. Implications: Behavioral therapy in men, alone or combined with a-blocker therapy, consistently showed large and statistically significant nocturia reductions and favorable effects on sleep and quality of life. Based on these findings, behavioral therapy, while not statistically superior to alpha-blocker therapy, may provide a meaningful treatment option for men with nocturia.

METHODS Our criteria were defined based on the analyses of the clinical presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), subepithelial eosinophilic esophagitis (sEoE) and eosinophilic esophageal myositis (EoEM), identified by endoscopy, manometry and serum immunoglobulin E levels (s-IgE), in combination with histological and polymerase chain reaction analyses on esophageal tissue samples. RESULTS In five patients with EoE, endoscopy revealed longitudinal furrows and white plaques in all, and fixed rings in two. In one patient with sEoE and four with EoEM, endoscopy showed luminal compression only. Using manometry, failed peristalsis was observed in patients with EoE and sEoE with some variation, while EoEM was associated with hypercontractile or hypertensive peristalsis, with elevated s-IgE. Histology revealed the following eosinophils per high-power field values. EoE = 41.4 +/- 7.9 in the epithelium and 2.3 +/- 1.5 in the subepithelium; sEoE = 3 in the epithelium and 35 in the subepithelium (conventional biopsy); EoEM = none in the epithelium, 10.7 +/- 11.7 in the subepithelium (conventional biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection) and 46.8 +/- 16.5 in the muscularis propria (peroral esophageal muscle biopsy).

Yet little research has been undertaken on techniques that could protect eyewitnesses from the influence of misinformation, despite the dangerous consequences of distorted testimony. In this article, a method of enhancing self-confidence, called reinforced self-affirmation (RSA), was proven to reduce the misinformation effect in five experiments. First, participants watched or heard an original event take place. They were then exposed to post-event material containing false information about that event, and finally they were given a memory test about the original material. The RSA, which took place either before the post-event material or before the final test, consisted of self-affirmation (recalling the greatest achievements in life) and external positive feedback (simulated good' results in a memory test or fake favourable results on personality tests). A meta-analysis of all five experiments revealed that the overall effect of RSA on reducing the misinformation was significant (effect size of 0.94), suggesting that this technique has the potential to be developed for practical use to make eyewitnesses less vulnerable to misinformation.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 3745, "input": "Analytical calculation methods for all the major components of the synchronous inductance of tooth-coil permanent-magnet synchronous machines are reevaluated in this paper.

Here, we have a distributed collection of agents with processing and cooperation capabilities. These agents observe noisy samples of a desired state through a linear model and seek to learn this state by interacting with each other. Although this problem has attracted significant attention and been studied extensively in fields including machine learning and signal processing, all the well-known strategies do not achieve team-optimal learning performance in the finite-horizon MSE sense. To this end, we formulate the finite-horizon distributed minimum MSE (MMSE) when there is no restriction on the size of the disclosed information, i.e., oracle performance, over an arbitrary network topology. Subsequently, we show that exchange of local estimates is sufficient to achieve the oracle performance only over certain network topologies. By inspecting these network structures, we propose recursive algorithms achieving the oracle performance through the disclosure of local estimates. For practical implementations we also provide approaches to reduce the complexity of the algorithms through the time-windowing of the observations. Finally, in the numerical examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of the introduced algorithms in the finite-horizon MSE sense due to optimal estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It also used a linear multiple regression (forward stepwise method) to identify the contribution of neuromuscular outcomes to previously published improvements in the timed-up-and-go test and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor subscale score. Methods: Thirty-nine patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned to three groups: control (C), RT, and RTI. RT and RTI groups performed resistance exercises twice a week for 12 wk, and only the RTI group used unstable devices to perform resistance exercises. The following neuromuscular outcomes were assessed: quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area, root mean square and mean spike frequency of electromyographic signal, peak torque, rate of torque development, and half relaxation time of the knee extensors and plantarflexors during maximum ballistic voluntary isometric contractions. TTV was calculated for lower limb exercises. Results: From pre-to posttraining, RTI improved all of the neuromuscular outcomes (P < 0.05) except half relaxation time of the knee extensors (P = 0.068), despite the lower TTV than RT (P < 0.05). RTI was more effective than RT in increasing the root mean square values of vastus medialis, mean spike frequency of gastrocnemius medialis, and rate of torque development of plantarflexors (P < 0.05). Stepwise regression identified the changes in mean spike frequency of gastrocnemius medialis as the best predictor of improvements in timed-up-and-go test (R-2 = 0.58, P = 0.002) and on-medication Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor subscale scores (R-2 = 0.40, P = 0.020).

Organizational strategies appear to have an important role in burnout reduction but need to be used in conjunction with individual programs. The latter are essential to both reducing stress and burnout in anesthesiologists and improving happiness and wellbeing. New measures of emotion regulation strategies such as mindfulness, self-compassion, resilience and empathy promotion have been shown to be approaches with substantial supporting evidence for reducing burnout and improving stress management.

In a patient who presents with the classic clinical features, restrictive ventilatory impairment with impaired diffusion and a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs showing a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, a definitive diagnosis of IPF can be made, provided all other causes of a radiological UIP pattern are excluded. Patients who present with atypical clinical features or an HRCT pattern classified as \"possible\" UIP, should be referred for a surgical lung biopsy. Once the diagnosis of IPF is confirmed, a patient-centred approached should be followed, as the stage of the disease, degree of impairment, rate of disease progression, comorbid illnesses and patient preferences all impact on long-term management.

Bradykinin, a potent vasoactive peptide, released from high molecular weight kininogen when it is cleaved by plasma kallikrein (a serine protease controlled by C1-INH), is the mediator of symptoms.

Knee pain and functional disability were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up using the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) and a visual analog scale (VAS). We performed two-way analysis of covariance for the clinical outcome variables to examine, time (baseline and follow-up), group (coexisting PFOA and isolated TFOA), and time-group interaction effects. Furthermore, we conducted post-hoc exploratory analysis to address the possibility that dividing patients according to location of PFOA (i.e., isolated lateral, isolated medial, and mixed [bilateral]) may identify a distinct subgroup with different changes in clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up. Results: We detected group effects only in scores of the JKOM pain subscale (P = 0.012) and VAS (P = 0.033), adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. Patients with coexisting PFOA have stable moderate level knee pain and functional disability throughout the year which is significantly worse than that in those with isolated TFOA. Post-hoc subgroup analysis demonstrated that change of knee pain likely varied with location of PFOA. Patients with isolated lateral PFOA had mild/moderate level knee pain, and their VAS scores were likely to improve, whereas those with mixed PFOA exhibited stable to worsening moderate/severe knee pain.

Although pig TNFR1 (pTNFR1) is known to mediate the effects of human TNF in a xenogeneic setting, it is unclear whether pig TNFR2 (pTNFR2) could contribute to xenograft rejection. Methods: We have cloned the cDNA of various pTNFR2 variants by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. We have characterized the predicted proteins with bioinformatic tools and conducted expression, affinity, and functional studies to investigate their roles. Results: We have identified four isoforms of pTNFR2: one comprising the four cysteine-rich domains (CRD) conserved between species, a shorter variant (pTNFR2 Delta E7-10) encoding for a soluble isoform, another with only three CRD due to the lack of exon 4 (pTNFR2 Delta E4), and a fourth variant containing both modifications. Accordingly, multiple mRNA transcripts were observed by northern blotting. Quantitative RT-PCR determined high pTNFR2 expression in lung and immune cells and detected the two alternative splicings in all cells/tissues examined. The full receptor was moderately expressed on the surface of pig cells such as porcine aortic endothelial cells and PK-15 and was regulated by TNF. On the contrary, the membrane-bound pTNFR2 Delta E4 was located only intracellularly. Plasmon resonance studies showed that pTNFR2 binds pig and human TNF alpha with high affinity, but pTNFR2 Delta E4 interacts poorly with pig TNF alpha and does not bind to the human cytokine. Moreover, pull-down experiments with the two recombinant soluble isoforms consistently demonstrated that the two bound together and soluble pTNFR2 Delta E4 was able to modulate the TNF inhibitory activity of pTNFR2-GST in a cell-based assay. Conclusion: The pTNFR2 may participate in the process of xenograft rejection and other related events, as well as be used in soluble form to block TNF in this setting.

Intermyofibrillar mitochondrial content increased with training because of increases in mitochondrial size in men, but not women, with no changes in subsarcolemmal mitochondria in either sex. REX increased whole muscle contractile performance similarly in men and women. In contrast, adaptations in single-muscle fiber force production per CSA (i.e., tension) and contractile velocity varied between men and women in a fiber type-dependent manner, with adaptations being explained at the molecular level by differential changes in myosin-actin cross-bridge kinetics and mechanics and single-fiber MHC protein expression. Our results are notable compared with studies of high-intensity REX because they show that the effects of moderate-intensity REX in older adults on muscle fiber size/structure and myofilament function are absent or modest. Moreover, our data highlight unique sex-specific adaptations due to differential cellular and subcellular structural and functional changes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Moderate-intensity resistance training causes sex-specific adaptations in skeletal muscle structure and function at the cellular and molecular levels in inactive older adult men and women with knee osteoarthritis. However, these responses were minimal compared with high-intensity resistance training. Thus adjuncts to moderate-intensity training need to be developed to correct underlying cellular and molecular structural and functional deficits that are at the root of impaired physical function in this mobility-limited population.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 36054, "input": "The limbic system has a central role for the integration of several cognitive and visceral functions through an extended network of connections involving the hippocampus and the amygdala. A number of studies performed in humans have been dedicated to the investigation of supratentorial limbic pathways by means of non-invasive MRI approaches, such as DTI. However, detection of possible limbic connections involving the brainstem and the spinal cord is still missing. Subtentorial limbic pathways have been previously studied in animals by means of invasive approaches, including viral tracing. The detection of limbic connections with the brainstem and the spinal cord has raised several new hypotheses regarding the interaction between the central nervous system and the periphery of the body. We investigated subtentorial limbic connections in twenty-one healthy humans by means of probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution tractography. Our connectivity analysis showed, for both the hippocampus and the amygdala, a high probability of connections with the midbrain, pons, and bulb. Moreover, hippocampal and amygdalar pathways reaching the cervical spinal cord were also detected. Quantitative evaluation of diffusion parameters was also performed. Findings of the present study are in agreement with the literature and provide the first report of possible limbic connections between the brain stem and the spinal cord in human brain. Since these pathways might also have important implications both in physiological and pathological contexts, further studies should be conducted in order to confirm our data as well as to define functional features of these brain connections.

The first step enables the specification of legitimate states and an intuitive (but imprecise) specification of the desired functional behaviors in the set of legitimate states (hence the term \"shadow\"). After creating the shadow specifications, we systematically introduce the main variables and the topology of the desired self-stabilizing system. Subsequently, we devise a parallel and complete backtracking search towards finding a self-stabilizing solution that implements a precise version of the shadow behaviors, and guarantees recovery to legitimate states from any state. To the best of our knowledge, the shadow/puppet synthesis is the first sound and complete method that exploits parallelism and randomization along with the expansion of the state space towards generating self-stabilizing systems that cannot be synthesized with existing methods. We have validated the proposed method by creating both a sequential and a parallel implementation in the context of a software tool, called Protocon. Moreover, we have used Protocon to automatically design three new self-stabilizing protocols that we conjecture to require the minimal number of states per process to achieve stabilization (when processes are deterministic): 2-state maximal matching on bidirectional rings, 5-state token passing on unidirectional rings, and 3-state token passing on bidirectional chains.", "class": "Computer Science"}, {"id": 45886, "input": "We previously reported the successful induction of complete spermatogenesis of mice in neonatal testis tissues cultured on agarose gel, with the culture medium supplemented with a bovine serum albumin product, AlbuMAX.

The test apparatus contained two compartments-one of which was equipped with a sensor that, once triggered, released the trap door of the adjacent compartment. Sixty-six exhaustive pairs of 12 bats were tested, with each bat in each role, twice when the recipient was present and twice when absent. Bats decreased their behavior of releasing the trapdoor in both conditions over time, decreasing the behavior slightly more rapidly in the recipient absent condition.

Until now, only molecular networks or the biomedical literature were used, whereas many other resources are available. Method: We propose here to consume a diverse and larger set of resources using linked data related either to genes, drugs or diseases. One of the advantages of linked data is that they are built on a standard framework that facilitates the joint use of various sources, and thus facilitates considering features of various origins. We propose a selection and linkage of data sources relevant to pharmacogenomics, including for example DisGeNET and Clinvar. We use machine learning to identify and prioritize pharmacogenes that are the most probably valid, considering the selected linked data. This identification relies on the classification of gene-drug pairs as either pharmacogenomically associated or not and was experimented with two machine learning methods -random forest and graph kernel-, which results are compared in this article. Results: We assembled a set of linked data relative to pharmacogenomics, of 2,610,793 triples, coming from six distinct resources.

Material/Methods: Human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were incubated with different concentrations of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) to induce the PD model. The expression of miR-181a was then analyzed. After transfection with miR-181a mimic or scramble following MPP+ treatment, the expression of autophagy protein markers (LC3II, LC3I, and Beclin 1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling proteins (p-p38, p38, p-JNK, and JNK) and cell apoptosis were detected. Furthermore, the cells were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor and cultured in the presence or absence of p38 inhibitor SB203582 or JNK inhibitor SP600125, and the cell apoptosis was tested again. Results: The expression of miR-181a was gradually decreased with the increase of MPP+ concentration (P<0.05, P<0.01, or P<0.001).

Intention was assessed by asking \"Which of the following methods of preventing pregnancy do you intend to use after you deliver?\" Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with intent to use nonhormonal (NH) contraception(male/female condoms, abstinence, withdrawal and no method) or short-/medium-acting hormonal (SMH) contraception (birth control pill, patch, vaginal ring, injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate) compared with LARC (implant and intrauterine device) postpartum. Results: Twenty-three percent intended to use LARC, 53% an SMH method, and 24% an NH method. Participants who intended to use NH or SMH contraceptive methods over LARC were significantly more likely to believe that LARC is not effective at preventing pregnancy, to report that they do not make decisions to help reach their goals and that partners are not important when making contraceptive decisions. Other important factors were having a mother who was aged >19 years at first birth and had not graduated from high school, not having experienced a prior pregnancy or talked with parents about birth control options, and the perception of having limited financial resources.

In both cancer cell lines and a colitis-associated cancer model in mice, we found that GPRC5A deficiency reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis as well as inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Through RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis, we identified oxidative stress associated pathways were dysregulated. Moreover, in GPRC5A deficient cells and mouse tissues, the oxidative agents were reduced partially due to increased glutathione (GSH) level. Mechanistically, GPRC5A regulates NF-B mediated Vanin-1 expression which is the predominant enzyme for cysteamine generation. Administration of cystamine (the disulfide form of cysteamine) in GPRC5A deficient cell lines inhibited -GCS activity, leading to reduction of GSH level and increase of cell growth. Taken together, our studies suggest that GPRC5a is a potential biomarker for colon cancer and promotes tumorigenesis through stimulation of Vanin-1 expression and oxidative stress in colitis associated cancer.

Compared to human DMBT1, it contains only four N-terminal SRCR domains. Northern blotting revealed transcripts of similar to 4.7 kb in size in the tissues analyzed. Analysis of ESTs suggested the existence of secreted and transmembrane variants. The porcine DMBT1 gene spans about 54 kb on chromosome 14q28-q29.

To this end, we combined depth extrapolation of 139 measurements limited to the topsoil with four digital soil mapping techniques: multiple linear regression, boosted regression trees, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines. Particular attention was given to vegetation characteristics as predictors. For both the stock in the upper 15 cm and 100 cm, a boosted regression trees approach was most informative as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the relative importance of predictors. The predictors of the stock in the upper 100 cm were soil type, groundwater level, clay fraction and community weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of plant height. These predictors, together with the CWM of specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, CWV and CWM of rooting depth, terrain slope, CWM of mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also explained the topsoil stock.

The pathological spectrum includes gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs), diffuse astrocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs), among others. Clinically, hemispheric PLGGs represent a well-recognized cause of intractable epilepsy in children and adolescents. With an excellent long-term outcome, surgery remains the cornerstone and patients with gross total resection typically do not need any further therapies. The recent literature about hemispheric PLGGs was reviewed to provide an up-to-date overview of the molecular and cell biology of these tumors. Hemispheric PLGGs can harbor multiple alterations involving BRAFV600E, FGFR, NTRK, MYB/MYBL1, IDH, and BRAF-KIAA1549 fusions. However, the clinical significance of most of these alterations is still to be defined. The role of RAS/MAPK mutations and other alterations in hemispheric PLGGs is of interest from diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic perspectives.

They not only influence peoples' concepts of themselves but may also affect their behavior in social environments. In the current review, we describe alterations of self-related processing in borderline personality disorder (BPD). We chose BPD as an example of a mental disorder of which impairments in self-functioning and identity constitute a major feature. Since terminology used in clinical research on self-referential processing is diverse and often confusing, we start with reviewing some of the main concepts in this area of research using a conceptual framework provided from social psychology. Most studies on self-referential processing in BPD focused on descriptions of self-esteem and revealed a negative self-concept, particularly expressed by explicitly reported low self-esteem. Moreover, self-esteem is unstable in BPD and likely reactive to self-relevant cues. BPD patients are prone to negative emotions with respect to themselves, such as self-disgust and shame. First data point to altered self-related motives, too. In conclusion, although explicit self-esteem is widely studied as a global and trait-like feature of BPD, there is a strong lack of studies that take the complexity of the construct self-esteem into account. Further studies on alterations in self-related processes are required to deepen our understanding of impairments of the self-concept in BPD and enable the improvement of psychosocial therapeutic approaches.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 9634, "input": "Blackspot is a subsurface potato damage resulting from impacts during harvesting. This type of bruising represents substantial economic losses every year. As the tubers do not show external symptoms, bruise detection in potatoes is not straightforward. Therefore, a nondestructive and accurate method capable of identifying bruised tubers is needed. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been shown to be able to detect other subsurface defects such as bruises in apples. This method is nondestructive, fast and can be fully automated. Therefore, its potential for non-destructive detection of blackspot in potatoes has been investigated in this study. Two HSI setups were used, one ranging from 400 to 1000 nm, named Visible Near Infrared (Vis-NIR) and another covering the 1000-2500 nm range, called Short Wave Infrared (SWIR). 188 samples belonging to 3 different varieties were divided in two groups. Bruises were manually induced and samples were analyzed 1, 5, 9 and 24 h after bruising. PCA, SIMCA and PLS-DA were used to build classifiers. The PLS-DA model performed better than SIMCA, achieving an overall correct classification rate above 94% for both hyperspectral setups. Furthermore, more accurate results were obtained with the SWIR setup at the tuber level (98.56 vs. 95.46% CC), allowing the identification of early bruises within 5 h after bruising. Moreover, the pixel based PLS-DA model achieved better results in the SWIR setup in terms of correctly classified samples (93.71 vs. 90.82% CC) suggesting that it is possible to detect blackspot areas in each potato tuber with high accuracy.

Existing power systems of such remote towns in Australia have adverse environmental impacts and contribute to global warming due to the utilization of fossil fuels, especially diesel and gas. The possible electricity supply systems for such towns can vary from a diesel/gas generator towards a hybrid system composed of a generator, Wind turbine, photovoltaic system, and battery energy storage. In order to limit the cost of the system and to propose the most economically feasible solution, various combinations of supply systems are considered. These systems are analyzed in this paper by the help of HOMER software to determine the optimal architecture and the control strategy of the supply system. This study has used real demand data of the town, as well as the prices of different electrical components in the Australian market. The scenario which yields the minimum cost of energy is defined and suggested. Also, a decision-making based technique is proposed to help the local electricity utility in finding the suitable solution in the case of budget limits on the investment and annual operation and maintenance. Another aim of this analysis is to investigate and illustrate the impact of a small annual load growth on the size of the selected components for the selected power system, as well as the total net present cost and the cost of electricity. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to analyze the impact of uncertainties of some of the parameters in the outcome of the study to obtain the optimized cost of the selected system.

Ten months of HFD (60% calories from fat) led to significant deficits in a 2-trial Y maze task, and nest building assay, and decreased voluntary locomotor activity. The HFD induced an inflammatory response, indicated by increased expression of several inflammatory markers. Substituting a low fat diet led to pronounced weight loss and correction of glucose intolerance, decreases in the inflammatory response, and improved performance on behavioral tasks in both wild-type and APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice. Insoluble beta-amyloid levels, and extent of tau phosphorylation were also lower following dietary reversal in APP/PSEN1 mice compared to high fat-fed animals, indicating that the inflammatory response may have contributed to key pathogenic pathways in the Alzheimer's disease model.

In this paper, a composite elliptical SRV model for each hydraulic fracturing stage is established, based on micro-seismic events. Both the SRV and the outer regions are assumed as single-porosity media with different formation physical parameters. Based on unstructured perpendicular bisection (PEBI) grids, a mathematical model considering Darcy flow, diffusion and adsorption/desorption in shale gas reservoirs is presented. The numerical solution is obtained by combining the control volume finite element method with the fully implicit method. The model is verified by a simplified model solution. The MFHW Blasingame production decline curves, which consider elliptical SRVs in shale gas reservoirs, are plotted by computer programming. The flow regions can be divided into five flow regimes: early formation linear flow, radial flow in the SRV region, transient flow, pseudo radial flow and boundary dominated flow. Finally, the effect of six related parameters, including the SRV area size, outer region permeability, SRV region permeability, Langmuir pressure, Langmuir volume and diffusion coefficient, are analyzed on type curves.

This paper estimates the capacity value of a load-shifting resource which is capable of providing multiple services. The capacity value represents the contribution of a resource to generation adequacy and an understanding of this contribution is important to compare how different power system resources can assist power system operators and planners. Additionally, policy-makers and market operators need an appreciation of the capacity value of different resources in order to design capacity remuneration mechanisms. A building energy model coupled with a power system model, co-optimizing the supplyside and the demand-side, is employed in this paper to estimate the capacity value of a specific load shifting resource. The resource examined is electric thermal storage heating devices for space and water heating. Ireland is used as a test case. It was found that these load-shifting devices can provide an adequacy contribution to the power system and thus have a capacity value. The capacity value, for the Irish case, can be up to 26% for the DR resource in question for the given year but the values are typically much lower due to operational constraints (reserve provision) and due to occupancy profile impacts. The results highlight the need for holistic modeling of demand response resources, as well as the need for additional work for different load-shifting resources and more data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

[International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 33, 6, 1992]. After near 30 years, the dual BIE/BEM for the problem containing a zero-thickness barrier was revisited mathematically to study the rank deficiency from the viewpoint of the updating term and the updating document of singular value decomposition (SVD) [Journal of Mechanics, 31, 5, 2015]. In this paper, we revisit the dual BEM from the physical point of view. Although there is no zero-thickness barrier in the real world, it is always required to simulate a finite-thickness degenerate boundary to be zero-thickness in comparison with sea, air or earth scale. For example, a sheet pile, a screen, a crack problem, a thin airfoil and a breakwater were modeled by the geometry of zero-thickness. The role of the dual BEM is evident since Lafe et al. [Journal of the Hydraulics Division-ASCE, 106, 6, 1980] used the conventional BEM to model the finite-thickness pile wall to geometrically approximate zero-thickness barrier but numerically yielding divergent solution. On the contrary, we physically model the finite-thickness breakwater as a zero-thickness barrier. The breakwater is employed as an illustrative case to demonstrate that the dual BEM simulated by a zero-thickness barrier can yield more acceptable results to match the experiment data in comparison with those of the finite thickness using the conventional BEM.

Despite previous experimental evidence accounting for the role of the main biochemical factors acting on these processes, the underlying mechanisms controlling them are still unknown. Therefore, we propose a mathematical model of the processes of flat bone and suture formation, taking into account several biological events. First, we model the growth of the flat bones and the formation of sutures and fontanels as a reaction diffusion system between two proteins: TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3. The former is expressed by osteoblasts and allows adjacent mesenchymal cells differentiation on the bone fronts of each flat bone. The latter is expressed by mesenchymal cells at the sutures and inhibits their differentiation into osteoblasts at the bone fronts. Suture interdigitation is modelled using a system of reaction diffusion equations that develops spatio-temporal patterns of bone formation and resorption by means of two molecules (Wnt and Sclerostin) which control mesenchymal cells differentiation into osteoblasts at these sites. The results of the computer simulations predict flat bone growth from ossification centers, sutures and fontanels formation as well as bone formation and resorption events along the sutures, giving rise to interdigitated patterns. These stages were modelled and solved by the finite elements method. The simulation results agree with the morphological characteristics of calvarial bones and sutures throughout human prenatal development and infancy. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting expression provides insight into the key factors that link change in temperature to change in travel time.

The results of the current study indicated that miR-30b was upregulated in RCC tissues from affected cell lines when compared with adjacent normal tissues and a normal kidney cell line, which is different to the downregulation of miR-30b as observed in other types of cancer. miR-30b is associated with RCC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis, which indicated that miR-30b acts as an oncogene in RCC. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the upregulation of miR-30b in RCC tissues and describe miR-30b as an oncogene in RCC in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis.

A PCR array analysis of Wnt pathway activation in DECs identified genes dysregulated by mineral induction. Among them, DKK3expression levels were decreased, and further experiments were conducted to investigate its role in DEC osteogenesis. By comparing DECs grown in normal growth and mineral-induction media for 4 weeks, the present study confirmed that DKK3 was a potential target gene of osteogenesis through reverse transcliption-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-gPCR) and western blotting (WB). A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was introduced into DECs using a lentiviral vector to inhibit DKK3 expression. An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and Alizarin Red staining were performed to observe the DKK3-shRNA DECs. In addition, the osteogenic differentiation of DKK3-shRNA DECs was analyzed by RT-gPCR and WB. In vivo, DKK3-shRNA DECs seeded on hydroxyapatiteiP-tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) scaffolds were transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, followed by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. The results confirmed that DKK3 expression was downregulated during mineral induction in rat DECs. Lentivirus-mediated expression of DKK3 shRNA in DECs promoted calcified-nodule formation, ALP activity and the expression of P-catenin, runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteocalcin, compared with control cells. In vivo, the implanted section presented the majority of newly formed osteoid matrices and collagen, with limited space between the HA/TCP scaffolds and matrices. In conclusion, DKK3 expression negatively regulates the osteogenic differentiation of DECs and, conversely, downregulation of DKK3 may enhance DEC osteogenesis.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 20963, "input": "It is well known that the existence of unstable zero dynamics is recognized as a major barrier in many control systems. When the usual digital control with zero-order hold (ZOH) or fractional-order hold (FROH) input is used, unstable zero dynamics inevitably appear in the discrete-time model even though the continuous-time system with relative degree more than two is of minimum phase. This paper investigates the zero dynamics, as the sampling period tends to zero, of sampled-data models composed of a generalized sample hold function (GSHF), a continuous-time nonlinear plant and a sampler in cascade. More precisely, we show how an approximate sampled-data model can be obtained for nonlinear systems with two special GSHF cases such that sampled zero dynamics of the resulting model can be arbitrarily placed. Further, two GSHFs with appropriate parameters provide nonlinear zero dynamics as stable as possible, or with improved stability properties even when unstable, for a given continuous-time plant. It is also shown that the intersample behavior arising from the multirate input can be localised by appropriately selecting the design parameters based on the stability condition of the zero dynamics.

Stress influence lines (SIL) or its derivatives are recognized as very promising indices for damage detection. Compared with bridge global responses (such as displacement and acceleration), stress/strain can be more conveniently measured and is often more sensitive to local damages. This paper explores a novel damage localization approach by synthesizing SIL measurements from multiple locations, in which Dempster-Shafer data fusion technique is utilized. Compared with the measurement from a single sensor, more reliable damage-related information with the improved sensitivity and capability in damage localization can be obtained by synthesizing the measured SILs from a number of sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a numerical case study of the Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge. Different hypothetical scenarios, including single-damage case, double-damage, and no-damage cases, are considered in the validation. The comparison with the damage detection results using single-sensor data clearly indicates that the data fusion technique effectively enhance the consistency in the information (e.g., damage-induced structural change) and minimize non-consistent information (e.g. \"noise\" effect) from multiple sensors installed close to damage. The increasing number of sensors benefits the damage detection results. Excellent damage detection accuracy can be achieved, if different types of bridge components are properly selected for the monitoring.

However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness. One possible solution is to couple thermal energy storage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermal energy storage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output.

As an alternative sweetener, it is recommended for diabetics and for the prevention of dental caries. Xylitol is currently produced chemically on a large scale. Microbial production is lately becoming more attractive since the downstream processing is expected to be cheaper. Among microorganisms, yeasts are the best xylitol producers, particularly those belonging to the genus Candida. The key enzymes for xylitol production in yeasts are D-xylose reductase which, using either NADH or NADPH, reduces D-xylose to xylitol, and predominantly, NAD-linked xylitol dehydrogenase which reoxidizes xylitol to D-xylulose. Xylitol accumulation in yeasts is sensitive to environmental conditions such as nutrition, temperature, pH, inoculum, substrate and aeration, with the last two being critical for yeast growth and fermentation. Hemicellulosic hydrolysates derived from hardwood and particularly from agricultural residues, such as sugar cane bagasse, corn cabs, wheat and rice straw, are used as feedstock for xylitol production. Due to the presence of inhibitory components, some of the hydrolysates have to be treated prior to microbial utilization.

More recently, this technology has been increasingly applied to the study or treatment of human diseases, including Barth syndrome effects on the heart, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, beta-Thalassemia, and cystic fibrosis. CRISPR/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) genome editing has been used to correct disease-causing DNA mutations ranging from a single base pair to large deletions in model systems ranging from cells in vitro to animals in vivo. In addition to genetic diseases, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has also been applied in immunology-focused applications such as the targeting of C-C chemokine receptor type 5, the programmed death 1 gene, or the creation of chimeric antigen receptors in T cells for purposes such as the treatment of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or promoting anti-tumor immunotherapy. Furthermore, this technology has been applied to the genetic manipulation of domesticated animals with the goal of producing biologic medical materials, including molecules, cells or organs, on a large scale. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 has been teamed with induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to perform multiple tissue engineering tasks including the creation of disease models or the preparation of donor-specific tissues for transplantation. This review will explore the ways in which the use of CRISPR/Cas9 is opening new doors to the treatment of human diseases. Copyright (C) 2016, Chongqing Medical University.

In this paper, we present a new baseline correction method, the most-crossing method, to deal with the baseline of the strain signals collected from a sensor network installed on a concrete bridge. It is a piece-wise method based on probability theory. This method needs only a few manual parameter selection and can be used automatically for real time baseline correction.

A smaller percentage of variance was explained by differences in how people tended to be perceived by others (i.e., target effects). Both these individual differences were stable over time, were related to relevant personality measures, and group outcomes.

Sequence analysis was performed on 34 clones obtained by RDE; approximately half of these clones encoded 14 different hypothetical proteins and the other half encoded proteins involved with stress response, antioxidant defence, metabolism, transporter proteins, surface proteins, ribosomal proteins and others. The mRNA levels of eight T. cruzi genes obtained by RDE and Do were analysed by northern blotting to confirm the differential expression of these sequences. For six of the eight genes, TcLipDH, TcHT, TcFeSOD-A (iron superoxide dismutase-A), TcHSP70, TcHSP100 (heat shock protein) and Tc52 (thiol-transferase), mRNA levels in the drug-resistant T. cruzi population were at least twice those in the susceptible population. Further analysis of TcHSP70 showed that although the levels of TcHSP70 mRNA were four-fold higher in T. cruzi BZ-resistant population, no corresponding increase was observed in the levels of TcHSP70 protein expression.

The structure of the model consists of three steps: first, the measured CLDs are compressed down to a small set of parameters; second, these parameters are correlated with low order moments or a small number of percentiles of the PSD using regression models; third, the PSD low order moments are used as input variables, and a two layer-network sub-model is built to predict the PSD in a form of a histogram. Two key aspects of this modeling strategy are noteworthy, namely the construction of specialized parameterized functions (herein called generating functions) that reduce the number of parameters needed to train the model's two layer network component, as well as its ability to model a 2D size distribution. To demonstrate this paradigm, the model was used to determine the PSD of particles with an elongated morphology.

Assessing the users' satisfaction with the intervention they receive could enhance the evidence for the intervention effects. Thus, there is a need for valid and reliable measures to assess satisfaction with Web-based health interventions. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the reliability, factorial structure, and construct validity of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire adapted to Internet-based interventions (CSQ-I). Methods: The psychometric quality of the CSQ-I was analyzed in user samples from 2 separate randomized controlled trials evaluating Web-based health interventions, one from a depression prevention intervention (sample 1, N=174) and the other from a stress management intervention (sample 2, N=111). At first, the underlying measurement model of the CSQ-I was analyzed to determine the internal consistency. The factorial structure of the scale and the measurement invariance across groups were tested by multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. Additionally, the construct validity of the scale was examined by comparing satisfaction scores with the primary clinical outcome. Results: Multigroup confirmatory analyses on the scale yielded a one-factorial structure with a good fit (root-mean-square error of approximation =.09, comparative fit index =.96, standardized root-mean-square residual =.05) that showed partial strong invariance across the 2 samples. The scale showed very good reliability, indicated by McDonald omegas of .95 in sample 1 and .93 in sample 2. Significant correlations with change in depressive symptoms (r=-.35, P<.001) and perceived stress (r=-.48, P<.001) demonstrated the construct validity of the scale. Conclusions: The proven internal consistency, factorial structure, and construct validity of the CSQ-I indicate a good overall psychometric quality of the measure to assess the user's general satisfaction with Web-based interventions for depression and stress management.

The melanocortin system is a critical neural system underlying the control of body weight and other functions. Deficits in the melanocortin system may promote or exacerbate the comorbidities of obesity. This system has therefore generated great interest as a potential target for treatment of obesity. However, drugs targeting melanocortin receptors are plagued by problematic side effects, including undesirable increases in sympathetic nervous system activity, heart rate, and blood pressure. Circumnavigating this roadblock will require a clearer picture of the precise neural circuits that mediate the functions of melanocortins. Recent, novel experimental approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of these pathways. We here review the latest advances in our understanding of the role of melanocortins in food intake, reward pathways, blood pressure, glucose control, and energy expenditure. The evidence suggests that downstream melanocortin-responsive circuits responsible for different physiological actions do diverge. Ultimately, a more complete understanding of melanocortin pathways and their myriad roles should allow treatments tailored to the mix of metabolic disorders in the individual patient.

Methods: 72 New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to conventional ACL reconstruction group (group A), remnant-preserving and tensioning ACL reconstruction group (group B), and remnant-preserving and graft through remnant sleeve ACL reconstruction group (group C), with 24 rabbits (48 knees) in each group. The incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement in each group were analyzed using CT 3D reconstruction. Graft tendon-bone healing was monitored by HE and Masson staining, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the bone tissue surrounding the graft. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate the ratio of OPG/RANKL expression. Results: Histological analysis showed that group C had the best graft tendon-bone healing, followed by group B and group A at all time-points post-surgery. At weeks 3 and 6 post-surgery, OPG mRNA levels and OPG/RANKL values were higher in groups B and C compared to group A (P < 0.05). RANKL mRNA levels of groups B and C were lower than group A (P0.05). At 3 weeks post-surgery, the incidence and degree of bone tunnel enlargement were greater in group A compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Both remnant-preserving construction approaches promoted graft tendon-bone healing, the underlying mechanism may be associated with the upregulation of OPG mRNA and downregulation of RANKL mRNA in bone tunnel early post-operation.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 43211, "input": "Three-dimensional (3D) carbon materials derived from waste biomass have been attracted increasing attention in catalysis and materials science because of their great potential of catalyst supports with respect to multi-functionality, unique structures, high surface area, and low cost.

Unfortunately, they suffer from two errors namely numerical integration error and geometric error, which heavily degrade their reconstruction accuracy and pattern recognition performance. This paper describes a new kind of circularly orthogonal moments based on Chebyshev rational function. Unlike the conventional circularly orthogonal moments which have been defined in a unit disk, the proposed moment is defined in whole polar coordinates domain. In addition, given an order n, its radial projection function is smoother and oscillates at lower frequency compared with the existing circularly orthogonal moments, and so it is free of the geometric error and highly robust to the numerical integration error. Experimental results indicate that the proposed moments perform better in image reconstruction and pattern classification, and yield higher tolerance to image noise and smooth distortion in comparison with the existing circularly orthogonal moments.

Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 431 women (40-90 years) without treatment. The concordance of the probability of fracture was assessed by the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and by Bland-Altman method. The kappa index was used to evaluate the agreement Results: The difference between the risks of a major osteoporosis fracture (MOFR) was 1.02 +/- 1.40% (95% CI -2 to 1.90) and -0.03 +/- 0.51% (95% CI -1.18 to 1.32) for the hip fracture risk (HFR). Agreement between MOFR and HFR FRAX scores was good (CCC 0.879, 95% CI 0.85-0.90 and CCC 0.821, 95% CI 0.79-0.85, respectively). The correlation between BMD of the femoral neck and fracture risk calculated by FRAXBMI was a moderate, MOFR (r = -0.55, P < .001) and HFR (r = -0.54, P < .001). The agreement between the recommendations of treatment was 87% (kappa 0.61).

Like DGL, YLLIP2 was able to hydrolyze TAG droplets covered by a lecithin monolayer, while HPL was not directly active on that substrate. These results were in good agreement with the respective kinetics of adsorption on phosphatidylcholine (PC) monomolecular films of the same three lipases, YLLIP2 being the most tensioactive lipase. YLLIP2 adsorption onto a PC monolayer spread at the air/water interface was influenced by pH-dependent changes in the enzyme/lipid interfacial association constant (K-Ads) which was optimum at pH 6.0 on long-chain egg PC monolayer, and at pH 5.0 on medium chain dilauroylphosphatidylcholine film. Using substrate monolayers (1,2-dicaprin, trioctanoin), YLLIP2 displayed the highest lipolytic activities on both substrates in the 25 -35 mN m(-1) surface pressure range. YLLIP2 was active in a large pH range and displayed a pH-dependent activity profile combining DGL and HPL features at pH values found in the stomach (pH 3 -5) and in the intestine (pH 6-7), respectively. The apparent maximum activity of YLLIP2 was observed at acidic pH 4-6 and was therefore well correlated with an efficient interfacial binding at these pH levels, whatever the type of interfaces (Intralipid emulsions, substrate or PC monolayers). All these findings support the use of YLLIP2 in enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, a pathological situation in which an acidification of intestinal contents occurs.

Both compounds are antibiotics. Notably, a number of other riboflavin analogs are currently under investigation with regard to the development of novel antiinfectives. As a first step towards understanding the metabolism of riboflavin analogs in humans, the key enzymes flavokinase (EC 2.7.1.26) and FAD synthetase (EC 2.7.7.2) were studied. Human flavokinase efficiently converted RoF and AF to roseoflavin mononucleotide (RoFMN) and 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin mononucleotide (AFMN), respectively. Human FAD synthetase accepted RoFMN but not AFMN as a substrate. Consequently, roseoflavin adenine dinucleotide (RoFAD) was synthesized by the latter enzyme but not 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin adenine dinucleotide (AFAD). The cofactor analogs RoFMN, AFMN and RoFAD have different physicochemical properties as compared to FMN and FAD. Thus, the cofactor analogs have the potential to render flavoenzymes inactive, which may negatively affect human metabolism. RoF, but not AF, was found to inhibit human flavokinase. In summary, we suggest that AF has a lower toxic potential and may be better suited as a lead structure to develop antimicrobial compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Concerning parenting alliance, both mothers and fathers depended on own and partner's variables.

Main methods: Rings of human umbilical veins were mounted in organ baths containing Krebs buffer maintained at 37 degrees C and purified proteases were introduced in the bathing fluid along with additional drugs/proteins that permit mechanistic analysis of effects. Key findings: The previously described contractile response to human recombinant tissue kallikrein (KLK-1, 1-10 nM) is not influenced by metabolic inhibitors, suggesting its dependence on a preexisting reservoir of low molecular weight-kininogen (LK). Active plasma kallikrein (apK, <= 5 nM) was inactive in fresh tissues, unless high molecular weight-kininogen (HK, 39-197 nM) replenishment was applied. The effects of KLK-1 and HK + apK are abolished by pretreating tissues with icatibant, but not with tranexamic acid. C1-esterase inhibitor inhibited only HK + apK.

Here, the authors investigated the association between treatment method and long-term Medicare expenditures in elderly patients with aneurysmal SAH. METHODS The authors performed a cohort study of 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service claims data for elderly patients who had undergone treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms in the period from 2007 to 2012. To control for measured confounding, the authors used propensity score adjusted multivariable regression analysis with mixed effects to account for clustering at the hospital referral region (HRR) level. An instrumental variable (regional rates of coiling) analysis was used to control for unmeasured confounding by creating pseudo-randomization on the treatment method. RESULTS During the study period, 3210 patients underwent treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and met the inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 1206 (37.6%) had surgical clipping and 2004 (62.4%) had endovascular coiling. The median total Medicare expenditures in the 1st year after admission for SAH were $113,000 (IQR $77,500 $182,000) for surgical clipping and $103,000 (IQR $72,900 $159,000) for endovascular coiling. When the authors adjusted for unmeasured confounders by using an instrumental variable analysis, clipping was associated with increased 1-year Medicare expenditures by $19,577 (95% CI $4492 $34,663).

The aim of this study is to explore how rs4680 and implicit emotional processing of negative emotional stimuli could interact in affecting the Amy connectivity in bipolar depression. Forty-five BD patients (34 Met carriers vs. 11 Val/Val) underwent fMRI scanning during implicit processing of fearful and angry faces. We explore the effect of rs4680 on the strength of functional connectivity from the amygdalae to whole brain. Val/Val and Met carriers significantly differed for the connectivity between Amy and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and supramarginal gyrus. Val/Val patients showed a significant positive connectivity for all of these areas, where Met carriers presented a significant negative one for the connection between DLPFC and Amy. Our findings reveal a COMT genotype-dependent difference in corticolimbic connectivity during affective regulation, possibly identifying a neurobiological underpinning of clinical and prognostic outcome of BD. Specifically, a worse antidepressant recovery and clinical outcome previously detected in Val/Val patients could be associated to a specific increased sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli.

It can however be controlled by various forms of treatment, including topical, systemic agents, and phototherapy. Topical treatment is the first-line treatment and favored by most physicians, as this form of therapy has more patient compliance. Introducing a nanoemulsion for transporting cyclosporine as an anti-inflammatory drug to an itchy site of skin disease would enhance the effectiveness of topical treatment for psoriasis. The addition of nutmeg and virgin coconut-oil mixture, with their unique properties, could improve cyclosporine loading and solubility. A high-shear homogenizer was used in formulating a cyclosporine-loaded nanoemulsion. A D-optimal mixture experimental design was used in the optimization of nanoemulsion compositions, in order to understand the relationships behind the effect of independent variables (oil, surfactant, xanthan gum, and water content) on physicochemical response (particle size and polydispersity index) and rheological response (viscosity and k-value). Investigation of these variables suggests two optimized formulations with specific oil (15% and 20%), surfactant (15%), xanthan gum (0.75%), and water content (67.55% and 62.55%), which possessed intended responses and good stability against separation over 3 months' storage at different temperatures. Optimized nanoemulsions of pH 4.5 were further studied with all types of stability analysis: physical stability, coalescencerate analysis, Ostwald ripening, and freeze-thaw cycles.

Using a cancer-focused array, we examined methylation at 933 CpGs in 517 invasive breast tumors in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study to determine whether methylation patterns differ by exposure to tobacco smoke. Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to compare tumor methylation profiles between smokers and never smokers, overall, or stratified on hormone receptor (HR) status. Modest differences in CpG methylation were detected at p < 0.05 in breast tumors from current or ever smokers compared with never smokers. In stratified analyses, HR- tumors from smokers exhibited primarily hypomethylation compared with tumors from never smokers; hypomethylation was similarly detected within the more homogeneous basal-like subtype. Most current smoking-associated CpG loci exhibited methylation levels in former smokers that were intermediate between those in current and never smokers and exhibited progressive changes in methylation with increasing duration of smoking. Among former smokers, restoration of methylation toward baseline (never smoking) levels was observed with increasing time since quitting.

Methods: A stratified random-sample cross-sectional survey of EDs in the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was conducted from 1997-2001; for patients younger than 19 years, we used all visits [n = 33,654; injury-related visits (IRVs) = 13,496, SIRVs = 29901. We examined both the external cause codes and the actual verbatim text of all IRVs. National estimates of pediatric IRVs were obtained using the assigned patient visit weights in the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey databases and SUDAAN 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Results: Sports injuries resulted in 2.5 million visits annually, or 23% of ED IRVs. Male sex, older age (6-18 years), and white race/ethnicity are associated with higher rates of SIRVs. Cycling, basketball, playground injuries, and football resulted in the largest numbers of ED SIRVs. Leading diagnoses for SIRVs included fractures and dislocations, sprains and strains, open wounds, and contusions.

After controlling for demographic factors and insurance, Hispanic children were less likely to have an SIRV than white children (odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-0.9). Conclusions: Sports and recreation are the leading causes of pediatric ED IRVs.

Methods.-Individually age and sex-matched subjects with CM or EM (both without aura) and healthy controls (n=21 per group) underwent magnetic resonance imaging-based VBM. Results.-We found an increase of GM volume (GMV) in amygdala and putamen, in CM compared to controls. GMV of EM compared to controls did not differ statistically significantly. Headache frequency in all migraineurs (EM and CM) correlated positively with GMV in putamen, frontal and temporal gyrus and negatively in left cuneus. Conclusion.-CM is associated with structural changes in brain regions involved in pain processing but also in affective and cognitive aspects of pain. Some GM alterations are correlated with headache frequency assessed in EM and CM. The findings support the assumption that chronic pain alters brain plasticity.

Instead, in 2 studies, we explored education's potential ability to reduce extreme negative attitudes toward terrorists. Study 1 compared students in a college course on terrorism (treatment) with wait-listed students, measuring prosocial attitudes toward a hypothetical terrorist.

Univariate analysis showed that prior exposure to high dose steroids, diabetes mellitus, mechanical ventilation, prior use of colistin and tigecycline, presence of septic shock, and critical care unit stay were associated with a poor outcome. High dose steroids and presence of septic shock were significant on multivariate analysis. Crude mortality rate was 63.5%. 70.3% of the deaths were attributed to the bacteremia. On acquisition, 39 patients had septicemia. Despite high index of suspicion and initiation of colistin and/or tigecycline in 18/39 patients, a grim outcome could not be averted and 37 patients died within 2.16 days. Seven patients had transient benign bacteremia; three of which were treated with removal of the line. The remaining four did not receive any antibiotics due to withdrawal of care and died within 26.25 days of acquiring the bacteremia, with no signs of persistent infection on follow up. A prolonged hospital stay is frequently associated with loss of functionality, and steroid and antibiotic exposure. These factors seem to impact the mortality of AB bacteremia, a disease with high mortality rate and limited therapeutic options.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 43573, "input": "To increase environmental health literacy (EHL) and leadership skills in Latino youth in Salinas, CA., we worked from 2012-2015 with 15 members of the CHAMACOS Youth Community Council (YCC), an outreach arm of a longitudinal study of impacts of environmental chemicals on children's health.

AAL systems typically consist of multitudes of sensors and embedded devices, generating large amounts of medical and ambient data. However, these biomedical sensors lack the processing power to perform key monitoring and data-aggregation tasks, necessitating data transmission and computation at central locations. The focus here is on the development of a scalable and context-aware framework and easing the flow between data collection and data processing. The resource-constrained nature of typical wearable body sensors is factored into our proposed model, with cloud computing features utilized to provide a real-time assisted-living service. With the myriad of distributed AAL systems at play, each with unique requirements and eccentricities, the challenge lies in the need to service these disparate systems with a middleware layer that is both coherent and flexible. There is significant complexity in the management of sensor data and the derivation of contextual information, as well as in the monitoring of user activities and in locating appropriate situational services. The proposed CoCaMAAL model seeks to address such issues and implement a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for unified context generation. This is done by efficiently aggregating raw sensor data and the timely selection of appropriate services using a context management system (CMS). With a unified model that includes patients, devices, and computational servers in a single virtual community, AAL services are enhanced.

Design: Descriptive analysis of primary data from the Spanish National Health Survey, 2012. Main outcome measures: Utility indices were obtained through the EQ5D5L questionnaire included in the survey, and utilization rates of consultations, hospitalizations, emergency services, and medication intake. HRQOL and utilization rates were systematically compared between women diagnosed with UI, women diagnosed with other chronic conditions (OCC) and healthy women of the same age. Results: Utility indices were 0.47 in UI women versus 0.78 and 0.96 in women diagnosed with OCC and healthy women, respectively. Each year 351,675 Quality Adjusted Life Years are lost in Spain due to UI in the population of women aged 60 and over. Resource utilization of these women was significantly higher than that of other women. Conclusions: UI has a larger impact on both HRQOL and healthcare consumption in women who are aged 60 and over, than OCC.

Despite using layered encryption, these systems are still vulnerable to timing analysis, wherein an eavesdropper can use traffic correlation mechanisms to identify the source of packets arriving at a destination. Mixes are intelligent routers or proxy servers that aim to provide packet source anonymity from timing analysis by delaying and shuffling the order of received packets prior to transmission. Such shuffling strategies naturally increase latency and result in a tradeoff between anonymity and latency. This paper investigates this tradeoff in a network of mixes, by deriving the optimal routing for sources which maximizes weighted sum of anonymity and delay. The achievable anonymity is characterized analytically for a general multipath model, and it is shown that under light traffic conditions, there exists a unique single route strategy, which achieves the optimal delay anonymity tradeoff. A low complexity algorithm is presented that derives the optimal routes to achieve a desired tradeoff. The light traffic results are specialized for a graphical model of existing practical anonymous systems, and optimal scaling behavior with the size of such networks is characterized.

But, these topologies are offering concerns with design complexity, power quality, dv/dt stresses, capacitor voltage balancing, etc. In view of these challenges, this paper proposes a simple Modular Cascaded Multilevel Inverter with modified Uni-Polar Shifted Carrier Pulse Width Modulation (MCMI-mUPSC PWM) topology for microgrids. The proposed MCMI topology eliminates the use of clamping diodes, capacitors, and requires only 1/4th (25%) of the DC input voltage that is used in any conventional topology to produce the same amount of output voltage. This leads to the reduction in switching devices' rating and dv/dt stresses. The proposed mUPSC PWM reduces the magnitude of hazardous lower order harmonics by shifting them to higher order components around the region of integral multiples of switching frequency. Thus, the proposed MCMI-mUPSC PWM topology simplifies the design of multilevel inverters along with aforesaid advantages. For the analysis, microgrid modelling and simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink (R). The effectiveness of the proposed topology is evaluated by calculating various power quality indices under dynamic and nonlinear loading conditions. These indices are compared with the conventional topology with respect to standard tolerances. From results, it is observed that the proposed topology has improved the power quality along with the elimination of some of the inherent problems of the multilevel inverters.

Lawn fertilizer and pet waste dominated N and P inputs, respectively, underscoring the importance of household actions in influencing urban watershed nutrient budgets. Watersheds retained only 22% of net P inputs versus 80% of net N inputs (watershed area-weighted averages, where net inputs equal inputs minus biomass removal) despite relatively low P inputs. In contrast to many nonurban watersheds that exhibit high P retention, these urban watersheds have high street density that enhanced transport of P-rich materials from landscapes to stormwater. High P exports in storm drainage networks and yard waste resulted in net P losses in some watersheds. Comparisons of the N/P stoichiometry of net inputs versus storm drain exports implicated denitrification or leaching to groundwater as a likely fate for retained N. Thus, these urban watersheds exported high quantities of N and P, but via contrasting pathways: P was exported primarily via stormwater runoff, contributing to surface water degradation, whereas N losses additionally contribute to groundwater pollution.

Sclerites have multiple roles, including structural support of the colony and protection from predators. The role of sclerites as a physical barrier that deters fungal infection, however, is unknown. This study examines the potential role of sea fan sclerites as protection from fungal infection. To accomplish this, four different fungi isolated from healthy sea fans were inoculated into 5 mL tubes filled with culture media and with sclerites from healthy and diseased fans placed on top. To determine whether chemical compounds in the sclerites impact infection, sclerites from healthy and diseased fans were extracted for several days with acetone prior to inoculation. Results showed that the sclerite layer delayed fungal infection from reaching the agar when compared to controls (tubes with agar but no sclerites). There was no difference between tubes with healthy and diseased sclerites, but there were differences among sclerites extracted with acetone.

By applying the improved model, a new compensated PID AQM controller is developed for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networks. The non-minimum phase characteristic caused by Pade approximation of the network delay restricts the direct application of control methods because of the unstable internal dynamics. In this paper, a parameter-varying dynamic compensator, which operates on tracking error and internal dynamics, is proposed to not only capture the unstable internal dynamics but also reduce the effect of uncertainties by unresponsive flows. The proposed dynamic compensator is then used to design a PID AQM controller whose gains are obtained directly from the state-space representation of the system with no further gain tuning requirements. The packet-level simulations using network simulator (ns2) show the outperformance of the developed controller for both queuing delay stability and resource utilization.

It combines the principles of bootstrapping with the technique of FE model calibration with damping equalization. The challenge for the calibration problem is to find an initial estimate of the parameters that is reasonably close to the global minimum of the deviation between model predictions and measurement data. The idea of model calibration with damping equalization is to formulate the calibration metric as the deviation between the logarithm of the frequency responses of FE model and a test data model found from measurement where the same level of modal damping is imposed on all modes. This formulation gives a smooth metric with a large radius of convergence to the global minimum. In this study, practical suggestions are made to improve the performance of this calibration procedure in dealing with noisy measurements. A dedicated frequency sampling strategy is suggested for measurement of frequency responses in order to improve the estimate of a test data model. The deviation metric at each frequency line is weighted using the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured frequency responses. The solution to the improved calibration procedure with damping equalization is viewed as a starting value for the optimization procedure used for uncertainty quantification. The experimental data is then resampled using the bootstrapping approach and the FE model calibration problem, initiating from the estimated starting value, is solved on each individual resampled dataset to produce uncertainty bounds on the model parameters and predictions.

The organization of data is referred to as the data structure's state, and the sequence of past operations constitutes the data structure's history. A data structure state can, therefore, be used as an oracle to derive information about its history. For history-sensitive applications, such as privacy in e-voting, it is imperative to conceal historical information contained within data structure states. Data structure history can be hidden by making data structures history independent. In this paper, we explore how to achieve history independence (HI). We observe that the current HI notions are significantly limited in number and scope. There are two existing notions of HI: 1) weak HI (WHI) and 2) strong HI (SHI). WHI does not protect against insider adversaries, and SHI mandates canonical representations, resulting in inefficiency. We postulate the need for a broad, encompassing notion of HI, which can capture WHI, SHI, and a broad spectrum of new HI notions. To this end, we introduce Delta HI, a generic game-based framework that is malleable enough to accommodate the existing and new HI notions. As an essential step toward formalizing Delta HI, we explore the concepts of abstract data types, data structures, machine models, memory representations, and HI.

Methods: Pre-treatment and serial on-treatment sera were available for 121 patients participating in the French clinical trial TORAVA, in which 171 randomised patients with mRCC received a bevacizumab and temsirolimus combination (experimental arm A) or a standard treatment: either sunitinib (B) or interferon-beta+bevacizumab (C).

Results: Multivariate statistical modelling discriminates serum profiles before and after several weeks of treatment for arms A and C. The combination A causes faster changes in patient metabolism than treatment C, detectable after only 2 weeks of treatment. Metabolites related to the discrimination include lipids and carbohydrates, consistently with the known RCC metabolism and side effects of the drugs involved. Comparison of the metabolic profiles for the three arms shows that temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, is responsible for the faster host metabolism modification observed in the experimental arm.

FRI rigidity surfaces are free of geometric singularities. We proposed a rigidity based Poisson -Boltzmann equation for biomolecular electrostatic analysis. Our approaches to surface and electrostatic modeling are validated by a set of 21 proteins. Our results are compared with those of established methods. Finally, being smooth and analytically differentiable, FRI rigidity functions offer excellent curvature analysis, which characterizes concave and convex regions on protein surfaces. Polarized curvatures constructed by using the product of minimum curvature and electrostatic potential is shown to predict potential protein-ligand binding sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Concerning inhalant allergens, the safety of SLIT is overall superior to that of subcutaneous immunotherapy in terms of systemic adverse events. No fatality has been ever reported, and episodes of anaphylaxis were described only exceptionally. Looking at the historical and recent trials, most (>90%) adverse events are \"local\" and confined to the site of administration. For this reason, a specific grading system has been developed by the World Allergy Organization to classify and describe local adverse events. There is an increasing amount of literature concerning oral desensitization for food allergens, referred to as oral immunotherapy. Also, in this case, local side effects are predominant, although systemic adverse events are more frequent than with inhalant allergens. We review herein the description of local side effects due to SLIT, with a special focus on large trials having a declared sample size calculation. The use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities nomenclature for adverse events is mentioned in this context, as recommended by regulatory agencies. It is expected that a uniform classification/grading of local adverse events will improve and harmonize the surveillance and reporting on the safety of SLIT.

However, no scientific evidence supports the traditional use. Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of U. rufa on BPH using in vitro and in vivo models. Materials and methods: In vitro studies screened the efficacy of a 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha R) inhibition and antioxidant activity of petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol and aqueous extracts from the stem of U. rufa. Phytochemical screening was performed to determine the active compound using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Ethyl acetate extract (UR-EtOAc) of U. rufa was used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy in vivo models. BPH was induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate (3 mg/kg) to male rats for 30 days. After 30 days of oral administration of UR-EtOAc at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg and finasteride at a dose of 1 mg/kg, the prostate weight, prostate index (PI), testosterone and androgen receptor (AR) levels, and histopathological alteration of prostate gland were determined. Also, oxidative status and toxicity indices were assessed. Results: UR-EtOAc exhibited the highest potency of inhibition of 5 alpha R and possessed potent antioxidants rich in phenolics and flavonoids contents. The active compound analyzed by HPLC was beta-sitosterol. In vivo results show a significant reduction in prostate weight, PI, and AR in all treated groups when compared to the BPH model group (P < 0.001). Also, the UR-EtOAc and finasteride treated groups had increased prostatic and serum testosterone levels when compared to the BPH model group. A histopathological investigation of the prostate glands supported the above results. UR-EtOAc elevated the antioxidant enzymes and reduced the malondialdehyde level in BPH-induced rats. Moreover, treatment of UR-EtOAc at all doses had no toxic effects on the vital organs and serum biochemical indices.

Deficits in information processing contributing to memory and sociability impairments are found across neuropsychiatric-related disorders. Previously, we have shown that mutations in the DTNBP1 gene (encoding dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 [dysbindin-1]) lead to abnormalities in synaptic glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and to cognitive deficits; glutamatergic transmission is important for cortical recurrent excitation that allows information processing in the PFC. To investigate possible means of restoring glutamate release and improving cognitive impairments, we assess the effects of increasing endogenous levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a dysbindin-1-deficient mouse model. Increasing endogenous levels of BDNF may aid in remediating cognitive deficits, given the roles of BDNF in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and neuroprotection. To increase BDNF, we use a novel strategy, repeated intraperitoneal injections of fingolimod (Gilenya). Sphingolipids have recently been shown to have therapeutic value in several neurology-related disorders. Both wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) genotypes were tested for sociability and recognition memory, followed by measuring endogenous BDNF levels and presynaptic [Ca2+](i) within the PFC. Both genotypes were treated for 1 week with either saline or fingolimod. Relative to WT mice, MUT mice demonstrated impairments in sociability and recognition memory and lower presynaptic calcium. After fingolimod treatment, MUT mice exhibited significant improvements in sociability and recognition memory and increases in presynaptic calcium and endogenous concentrations of BDNF. These results show promise for counteracting the cognitive impairments seen in neuropsychiatric disorders and may shed light on the role of dysbindin-1.

Processing of massive brain data has become a constant in neuroscience research and practice, which is vital in revealing the hidden information to better understand the brain functions and malfunctions. Brain data are routinely non-linear and non-stationary in nature, and existing algorithms and approaches to neural data processing are generally complicated in order to characterize the non-linearity and non-stationarity. Brain big data processing has pressing needs for appropriate computing technologies to address three grand challenges: (1) efficiency, (2) scalability and (3) reliability. Recent advances of computing technologies are making non-linear methods viable in sophisticated applications of massive brain data processing. General-purpose Computing on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) technology fosters an ideal environment for this purpose, which benefits from the tremendous computing power of modern graphics processing units in massively parallel architecture that is frequently an order of magnitude larger than the modern multi-core CPUs. This article first recaps significant speed-ups of existing algorithms aided by GPGPU in neuroimaging and processing electroencephalogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and etc. The article then demonstrates a series of successful approaches to processing EEG data in various dimensions and scales in a massively parallel manner: (1) decomposition: a massively parallel Ensemble Local Mean Decomposition (ELMD) algorithm aided by GPGPU can decompose EEG series, which forms the basis of further time-frequency transformation, in real-time without sacrificing the precision of processing; (2) synchronization measurement: a parallelized Nonlinear Interdependence (NLI) method for global synchronization measurement of multivariate EEG with speed-up of more than 1000 times, and it was successful in localization of epileptic focus; and (3) dimensionality reduction: a large-scale Parallel Factor Analysis which excels in run-time performance and scales far better by hundreds of times than conventional approach does, and it supports fast factorization of EEG with more than 1000 channels.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between mood symptoms associated with reproductive cycle events and features of the disorder indicative of a more severe lifetime course. Method: Totally, 158 women of at least 18 years of age participated in the study. Subjects were recruited through a specialist clinic at the Black Dog Institute, Sydney, Australia. Results: In total, 77% of women reported increases in mood symptoms during perimenstrual, postnatal or menopausal periods. These women had an earlier age of onset for depressive and hypo/manic episodes and a greater likelihood of comorbid anxiety disorders, rapid cycling and mixed mood compared to those who did not report such reproductive cycle-associated mood changes. Women who experienced postnatal episodes were also more likely to experience worse mood symptoms perimenstrually and menopausally. Conclusion: First, reproductive cycle event-related worsening of mood was associated with a more severe lifetime course of bipolar disorder, and, second, it appears that some women have a greater propensity to mood worsening at each of these reproductive cycle events.

Barriers and facilitators perceived by RNs to potentially impact on the adoption and implementation of PI prevention interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU) were examined. DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The target population was RNs practicing in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a major tertiary hospital, King Abdul-Aziz, Mecca, in Saudi Arabia. Fifty-six of the available 60 ICU RNs participated in this study. METHODS: Data were collected via survey using the Attitude towards Pressure injury Prevention instrument, which included 13 items rated with 4-point Likert scale, and the modified Barriers and Facilitators tool, which included 27 items. The survey was organized into 3 parts: demographic information, potential barriers to optimal skin care, and potential facilitators to skin care. The survey took 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Data were analyzed with descriptive-correlation statistics and multiple regression analysis. Thematic analysis was undertaken for qualitative data. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward PI prevention (mu = 38.19/52; 73.44%). No significant differences were found between demographic characteristics of the participants with the RNs' Attitude subscale and perceived barriers and facilitators associated with implementing PI prevention in the critical care setting. Several barriers influenced the ability of RNs to implement PI prevention strategies including time demands (beta =.388; P =.011), limitation of RNs' knowledge (beta = -.632; P =.022), and current documentation format (beta =.344; P =.046). Statistically significant facilitating factors that increased respondents ability to undertake PI prevention were ease of obtaining pressure-reduction surfaces (beta = -.388; P =.007), collaboration with interdisciplinary teams (beta =.37; P =.02), and availability of appropriate skin care products (beta =.44; P =.015). Thematic analysis of open-ended questions highlighted workload as a barrier that impedes the implementation of care specific to PI prevention. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study highlighted that ICU RNs had a positive attitude toward PI prevention. This study also identified perceived factors influencing PI prevention in the ICU, both facilitators and barriers. Perceived facilitators included availability of pressure-relieving support surfaces and appropriate skin care products and collaboration with the healthcare professional team.

The C-RC, of extracortical origin, is the essential neuron of the neocortex first lamina. It receives inputs from afferent fibers that reach the first lamina early in development. Although the origin and function of these original afferent fibers remain unknown, their target is the first lamina sole neuron: the C-RC. This neuron orchestrates the arrival, size and stratification of all pyramidal neurons (of ependymal origin) of the neocortex gray matter. Its axonic terminals spread radially and horizontally throughout the entirety of the first lamina establishing contacts with the dendritic terminals of all gray matter pyramidal cells regardless of size, location and/or eventual functional roles. While the neuron axonic terminals spread radially and horizontally throughout the first lamina, the neuronal' body undergoes progressive developmental dilution and locating any of them in the adult brain become quite difficult. The neuron bodies are probably retained in the older regions of the neocortex while their axonic collaterals will spread throughout its more recent ones and eventually will extend to great majority of the cortical surface. The neocortex first lamina evolution and composition and that of the C-RC are intertwined and mutually interdependent. It is not possible to understand the C-RC evolving morphology without understanding that of the first lamina. The first lamina composition and its structural and functional organizations obtained with different staining methods may be utterly different. These differences have added unnecessary confusion about its nature. The essential emptiness observed in hematoxylin and eosin preparations (most commonly used) contrast sharply with the concentration of dendrites (the cortex' largest) obtained using special (MAP-2) stain for dendrites. Only Golgi preparations demonstrate the numerous dendritic and axonic terminals that compose the first lamina basic structure. High power microscopic views of Golgi preparations demonstrate the intimate anatomical and functional interrelationships among dendritic and axonic terminals as well as synaptic contacts between them. The C-RC' essential morphology does not changes but it is progressively modified by the first lamina increase in thickness and in number of terminal dendrites and their subsequent maturation. This neuron variable morphologic appearance has been the source of controversy. Its morphology depends on the first lamina thickness that may be quite variable among different mammals. In rodents (most commonly used experimental mammal), the first lamina thickness, number and horizontal expansion of dendrites is but a fraction of those in humans. This differences are reflected in the C-RC' morphology among mammals (including humans) and should not be thought as representing new types of neurons.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 36107, "input": "The lung alveolar epithelium consists of type I and type II pneumocytes. In vivo, the type II cell is the progenitor cell from which the type I cell originates. When freshly-isolated type II cells are cultured under conventional conditions they rapidly lose their phenotypic properties and attain characteristics of type I cells. Taking advantage of this transdifferentiation, we sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed during culture of rat type II cells. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), a vacuolar-type H+ stop-ATPase (V-ATPase) C2 subunit gene (Atp6v1c2) was found to be enriched in freshly isolated rat type II cells compared to those cultured for 4 days. Northern blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of Atp6v1c2 during in vitro culture of isolated type II cells. Expression of Atp6v1c2 was significantly reduced early during in vitro culture: almost 90% reduction was observed after 24 h of incubation as determined by real-time PCR. In situ hybridization showed that Atp6v1c2 is expressed in both bronchiolar and alveolar lung epithelial cells, an expression pattern similar to that of surfactant protein B (SP-B). Multi-tissue Northern blotting revealed a unique tissue distribution with Atp6v1c2 expression limited to lung, kidney and testis.

Methods: This study included treatment seeking crack cocaine dependents women (n = 127) and elderly women without a psychiatric diagnosis (ELD, n = 49). The crack cocaine sample was divided in two groups according to their Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores: presence of history of childhood abuse and neglect (CRACK-ELS) and absence of ELS history (CRACK). TL was assessed by T/S ratio obtained from peripheral blood DNA using quantitative PCR assay. esults: CRACK and CRACK-ELS subjects exhibited shortened TL in comparison to the ELD group, despite their younger age. Among crack cocaine sample, CRACK-ELS group had significantly shorter telomeres than the CRACK group. Correlation analysis within crack cocaine group indicated that TL was negatively correlated with emotional abuse scores.

The mechanisms underlying these alterations are unknown, but a novel unexamined source is cross-network communication. Aberrant functional connectivity (FC) between the DMN and SN, whose activity is normally anticorrelated, reflects disease severity in many brain disorders. Further, stronger FC between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior insula has been reported in chronic pain, pointing to abnormal DMN-SN interactions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cross-network FC between the DMN and SN is abnormal in chronic pain, and is related to pain and associated symptoms. We used resting state fMRI to examine FC within and between the DMN and SN in 20 patients with chronic pain due to ankylosing spondylitis and 20 healthy controls. A whole-network analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients exhibited less anticorrelated FC between the SN and DMN, and the degree of cross-network abnormality tracked pain and disease-related symptoms. This suggests that cross-network FC is a metric of functional brain abnormality in chronic pain. In a complementary seed-based analysis, the PCC was strongly connected with the SN and weakly connected with the DMN in chronic pain compared to healthy controls, suggesting that the PCC acts as a hub for altered network interaction.

The membranes were synthesized both with and without the addition of solvents. The heating temperature during membrane synthesis was also being study for membrane performance in terms of percentage of permeate rejection and permeate flux. HDPE membrane produced from average particle size of 270.7 +/- 178.6 mu m achieved the highest permeate rejection and has highest heating temperature (180 degrees C).

To this end, we conducted an earwitness experiment in which some participants were exposed to discrepant cowitness information and provided their recollections repeatedly and under different conditions. Additionally, we examined the impact of cowitness intimacy by using a random assignment procedure, an aspect that has not been previously studied. With regard to the underlying processes, our findings clearly argue that informational rather than normative influence plays a dominant role.

But the network security situation cannot be observed directly and can only be measured by other observable data. In this paper the network security situation is considered as a hidden behavior. In order to predict the hidden behavior, some methods have been proposed. However, these methods cannot use the hybrid information that includes qualitative knowledge and quantitative data. As such, a forecasting model of network security situation is proposed on the basis of the hidden belief rule base (BRB) model when the inputs are multidimensional. The initial parameters of the hidden BRB model given by experts may be subjective and inaccurate. In order to train the parameters, a revised covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm is further developed by adding a modified operator. The revised CMA-ES algorithm can optimize the parameters of the hidden BRB model effectively. The case study shows that compared with other methods, the proposed hidden BRB model and the revised CMA-ES algorithm can predict the network security situation effectively to improve the forecasting precision by making full use of qualitative knowledge.

We developed a fast and rugged method to quantify side chain oxidized monoesters of DEHTP in human urine, namely 5OH-MEHTP, 5oxo-MEHTP, 2cx-MMHTP and 5cx-MEPTP. Sample preparation was kept simple with enzymatic deconjugation and a two column assembly for on-line sample clean up. Metabolites were identified with authentic standards and quantified via isotope dilution LC-MS/MS. The limit of quantification was 0.2 mu g/L for 5cx-MEPTP and 5oxo-MEHTP, 0.3 mu g/L for 5OH-MEHTP and 0.4 mu g/L for 2cx-MMHTP. Accuracy (relative recovery: 95.8-111%) and precision (relative standard deviation: <7%) were highly acceptable. In a pilot biomonitoring study with 34 volunteers (aged 25-61 (median 42), 20 female and 14 male) not known to be occupationally exposed to DEHTP, we could detect 5cx-MEPTP above the limit of quantification in 94% of the samples (median: 0.9 mu g/L, maximum: 38.7 mu g/L). The other metabolites investigated were detected at a lower rate and at lower concentration levels (5oxo-MEHTP: 21%, maximum: 1.8 mu g/L; 5OH-MEHTP: 18%, maximum: 3.4 mu g/L; 2cx-MMHTP: 9%, maximum: 0.9 mu g/L).

Differences in seasonal symptoms between BAD and appropriate comparison populations have been scrutinised only in small studies. Methods: Symptoms described on the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) were compared between 183 patients with BAD and 468 patients consulting their general practitioners. Statistical analyses were adjusted for differing age and gender distributions between the two groups. Results: Compared with the general practice patients, subjects with BAD reported greater seasonal fluctuations in mood (p = 0.003). On one measure BAD subjects reported increased seasonal changes in social activity (p<0.001) and greater weight fluctuation over the year (p = 0.001). The most striking differences were in sleep patterns; BAD subjects slept significantly more throughout the year, and slept for a mean of 1.8 h more in winter than in summer (versus a 1.0 h difference in the general practice group, p<0.001). Against 20% of the general practice group, 46% of BAD patients rated seasonal changes in well-being to be at least a moderate problem. Limitations: The SPAQ was designed as a screening instrument for Seasonal Affective Disorder, not for studies of this nature. Some of the reported differences, notably in social activity and weight changes, may reflect secondary psychosocial effects of BAD.

Complex estimators can be defined in a completely free fashion: the user only needs to provide the system with the symbolic expression of the estimator as a mathematical function.

Plaque severity (none,= 50% stenosis), composition (non-calcified [NCP], partially calcified [PCP], or calcified plaque [CP]), and segment involvement score (SIS) were visually graded. Multivariate analysis was performed, adjusting for CAD risk factors and cholesterol lowering medication use.

Clinical characteristics and prescription drugs of groups with major depressive disorder (ED-MDD), MDE with lifetime mania (ED-BP I), and MDE with lifetime hypomania (ED-BP II) were compared. Continuous variables between groups were compared using generalized linear regression with adjustments of age, gender, and ED subtype for pair-wise comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression with adjustments of age, gender, and ED subtype was employed to estimate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals between groups. Results: Two hundred and twenty-seven patients with EDs had a current MDE. Among them, 17.2% and 24.2% experienced associated manic and hypomanic episodes, respectively. Bipolar I and II patients displayed significantly poorer weight regulation, more severe impulsivity and emotional lability, and higher rates of co-occurring alcohol use disorders than ED-MDD patients. ED-BP I patients were found to have the lowest IQ, poorest working memory, and the most severe depression, suicidality and functional impairment among all patients. Patients with ED-BP II shared affect and behavioral dysregulations with ED-BP I, but had less severe degrees of cognitive and functional impairments than ED-BP I.

Individual stakeholders steadfastly guard their own interests in any investment decision, which seldom considers any positive gains to society. Green buildings, branded as partial public goods, involve rational and irrational factors, incurring extra transaction costs (TCs) and affecting the willingness of the stakeholders to take part. This paper examines how to reduce the TCs incurred during the game played in the decision-making process with the ultimate aim of promoting GB. In the game model, the developers and end-users negotiate and bargain over the TCs caused by GB in comparison with its conventional counterpart. The findings are that 1) TCs are the overriding barriers impeding the development of the GB market. Reducing TCs will facilitate supply and demand in the GB market; 2) the equilibrium payoffs for the developer and the end-user are proportional to their bargaining powers (the higher the bargaining power is, the more benefit it will gain from the GB transaction); 3) strengthening the bargaining power of the developer can increase the expected utility of developing GB; and 4) more fake GB products or less credible developers will result in higher TCs for the end-users and therefore lower payoffs will be expected. The findings stress that the choice between developers & end-users over investing in GB is a complex game problem, where TCs could be conceptualized and showed their important role. By minimizing the TCs incurred in the complex decision of GB, it will not only benefit themselves but also bring net regenerative outcomes to society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The modal coordinates were found using a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm and a curve-fitting technique was developed that uses optimization to find the modal parameters that best fit each side spectra of the PSD. Specifically, a pattern-search optimization method was combined with a clustering analysis algorithm and together they were employed in a series of stages in order to improve the estimates of the modal damping ratios. This method was used to estimate the damping ratios from a simulated bridge model subjected to moving traffic loads. The results of this method were compared to other established OMA methods, such as Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) and BSS methods, and they were found to be more accurate and more reliable, even for modes that had their PSDs distorted or altered by driving frequencies.

Based on a hierarchical coupling of the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM), the approach employs the FEM to solve a boundary value problem while using the DEM to derive the required nonlinear material responses at each FEM Gauss integration point. It helps to bypass the phenomenological constitutive model required in the conventional FEM simulations and offers a natural pathway for scale bridging. The current extension features further key consideration of the coupled hydro-mechanical behaviour in a saturated granular soil due to the presence of pore fluid and its flow. By invoking Terzaghi's effective stress principle, a u-p formulation is proposed for the multiscale framework to derive the effective stress from DEM solution of the representative volume element (RVE) embedded at each Gauss point which is then superimposed with the pore fluid pressure to obtain the total stress in solving the coupled governing equations for a fluid-solid mixture. This extension greatly enriches the predictive capacity of the multiscale approach for simulating saturated granular soils relevant to a wide variety of important civil/mining applications. The new approach is first benchmarked by closed-form solutions to classical 1D and 2D consolidation problems. It is then applied to simulate globally undrained biaxial compression tests on both dense and loose soils subjected to large deformation. We further discuss interesting fluid flow patterns and the failure modes (both localisation and diffuse liquefaction) observed from the simulations and provide detailed cross-scale analyses.

We built a multiplexed device, termed a 6-well impinging flow chamber, that imparts controlled WSS gradients to a six-well tissue culture plate. Using this device, we investigated the migratory response of lymphatic microvascular ECs, umbilical vein ECs, primary fibroblasts, and epithelial cells to WSS gradients on hours to days timescales. We observed that lymphatic microvascular ECs migrate upstream, against the direction of flow, a response that was unique among all the cells types investigated here. Time-lapse, live cell imaging revealed that the microtubule organizing center relocated to the upstream side of the nucleus in response to the applied WSS gradient. To further demonstrate the utility of our device, we screened for the involvement of canonical signaling pathways in mediating this upstream migratory response.

The d-(R)-enantiomer (d-2-HG) is an oncometabolite generated from -ketoglutarate (-KG) by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase, whereas l-(S)-2-HG is generated by lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in response to hypoxia. Because acidic pH is a common feature of hypoxia, as well as tumor and stem cell microenvironments, we hypothesized that pH may regulate cellular 2-HG levels. Herein we report that cytosolic acidification under normoxia moderately elevated 2-HG in cells, and boosting endogenous substrate -KG levels further stimulated this elevation. Studies with isolated lactate dehydrogenase-1 and malate dehydrogenase-2 revealed that generation of 2-HG by both enzymes was stimulated severalfold at acidic pH, relative to normal physiologic pH. In addition, acidic pH was found to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial l-2-HG removal enzyme l-2-HG dehydrogenase and to stimulate the reverse reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (carboxylation of -KG to isocitrate). Furthermore, because acidic pH is known to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and 2-HG is a known inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, we hypothesized that 2-HG may be required for acid-induced HIF stabilization. Accordingly, cells stably overexpressing l-2-HG dehydrogenase exhibited a blunted HIF response to acid.

Similarly, the exploitation of the most promising enzymatic detoxifying routes designed for trans-ZEN - which relies on the enzyme lactono hydrolase from Clonostachys rosea - has been assessed for the cis-isomer as well. Our results showed that both isomers can act as functional analogues with respect to xenoestrogenic activity, and several cis-ZEN metabolites with high biological potential have been identified. On the contrary, in spite of the high degree of structural analogy, the cis isomer showed a pattern of interaction with the degrading enzyme in stark contrast with that observed for trans-ZEN. For these reasons, the outcomes presented herein strongly support the inclusion of cis-ZEN in further studies of occurrence, metabolism and bioactivity assessment, and suggest the need for a dedicated handling for the cis isomer in risk assessment studies.

In this research paper we use this statistical approach to present a design methodology for the assessment of long span aeroelastic behavior that considers not only the flutter velocity as a unique safety index, as it is common practice, but also the trend of the total damping as a function of the wind velocity. Specifically, several significant in-service conditions are considered. Indeed, wind velocities at in-service conditions are events with a probability much higher than flutter condition, and in these cases a reliability analysis represents an added value in the design process. Therefore the statistical analysis of total damping at in service conditions is suggested as a useful tool to judge the performance of a structure especially for those structures where the wind-structure interaction represents the capital aspect of the overall design as it happens for the very long span bridges. Given the probability distribution of the input parameters, the Monte Carlo simulations allows one to statistically investigate the aeroelastic stability of the structure, in terms of range of variation of the total damping and flutter velocity, through an eigenvalue analysis. It is also possible to state the probability of not matching the design technical specification and the probability of being in a certain prescribed variation band. The mathematical and statistical background of the design methodology are presented and a case of study is analyzed with reference to the Messina Straits Bridge. The test case was chosen to stress the methodology with a challenging design, where extreme structural and aerodynamic solutions are implemented to reach a main span length of 3300 m and where the performances of the structure are deeply bounded to the reliability of the aeroelastic design.

Immunization with the gB(dCt) vector alone elicited a comparable gB-binding antibody response and a superior neutralizing response to that elicited by adjuvanted subunit gB. Immunization with the pp65 vector alone elicited robust T cell responses. Comparable immunogenicity of the combined gB(dCt) and pp65 vectors with the individual monovalent formulations was demonstrated. To demonstrate proof of principle for a bivalent rLCMV-based HCMV vaccine, the congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection model was used to compare rLCMV vectors encoding homologs of pp65 (GP83) and gB(dCt), alone and in combination versus Freund's adjuvanted recombinant gB. Both vectors elicited significant immune responses, and no loss of gB immunogenicity was noted with the bivalent formulation. Combined vaccination with rLCMV-vectored GPCMV gB(dCt) and pp65 (GP83) conferred better protection against maternal viremia than subunit or either monovalent rLCMV vaccine. The bivalent vaccine also was significantly more effective in reducing pup mortality than the monovalent vaccines.

The conjugacy of repeat angles was inspected in the similarity space, and the conjugate angles were advanced to distinguish the four-consecutives from the two-consecutives. Given the relativity of conjugate angles, the conjugate coefficient was brought forward to quantify the conjugate level of two perpendicular angles so as to find the optimal conjugate angles for the four-consecutives. The peak significance was proposed to discriminate sharp peaks against weak ones, and the similarity spaces of mono patterns were investigated to figure out the range of peak significance for the mono pattern, and thus the mono pattern could be identified with an absence of sharp peaks.

Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone, exhibits an anticancer effect in various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified via flow cytometry following AnnexinV/ propidium iodide staining. FASN activity was measured by monitoring oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect target gene and protein expression. The present study was performed to investigate whether the gene expression of FASN and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line. Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells and a higher protein level of FASN was expressed, compared with that in SW480, SNU-C2A or SNU-C5 cells. Emodin significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, which was caused by protein degradation due to elevated protein ubiquitination. Emodin also inhibited intracellular FASN enzymatic activity and reduced the levels of intracellular free fatty acids. Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial FASN inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities. Palmitate, the final product of the FASN reaction, rescued emodin-induced viability and apoptosis. In addition, emodin altered FASN-involved signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2.

Recent findings Pancreatic cancer has been discovered to have distinct molecular subtypes based on transcriptome analyses that may have implications for treatment. Recent studies are also mapping the complex molecular biology of this cancer as it relates to the core signaling abnormalities inherent to this disease. There have been discoveries of novel modes of regulation of pancreatic cancer development, including alterations in key transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and metabolic pathways. Studies of the tumor-associated microenvironment continue to reveal its complex role in tumor development.

In this study, dynamic models of the driveline system and the powertrain mounting system are respectively established in detail. The natural characteristic analyses of the two dynamic models reveal that engine order vibrations can stimulate a series of low-frequency resonances during the engine starts, which is finally embodied in the car body vibrations. Then, two dynamic models are coupled together to analyze the transient dynamic characteristics associated with engine starts. It is evident by simulations that the longitudinal vibration of car body is mainly transferred by the driveline, whereas the vertical vibration of car body is mainly transferred by the powertrain mounting system.

A sample community composed of four prospective users with individual storage is tested with various forms of shared connections. Most importantly, the results show that the benefit from shared rain barrels greatly increases under the climate change conditions compared with the historical rainfall data.

In the more realistic case of finite mass m of a force-exerting element free to recoil under mutual action-reaction, the recoil motion \"steals\" energy from the observable force action, so that the physically effective force exerted on a test element of mass M can be represented as the product of formula force and an inertial modulation factor Omega = m/(M + m) less than or equal to 1. Application of this Elementary result to classical electrodynamics shows that it can invalidate (as physics) many of the theorems universally taken for granted since the nineteenth century. For instance, the well-established mathematical theorem that a closed current loop external to a straight current-carrying test element necessarily exerts zero longitudinal ponderomotive force on the latter (for the Lorentz force law, the original Ampere force law, and all others differing from these only by an additive exact differential quantity) need not be valid physically, The reason is that the inertial factor Omega has been overlooked. Its presence as an extra factor (Green's function) multiplying the force differential can spoil the exact differential nature of the loop integrand. For instance, if the external loop is physically configured with a \"weak link,\" namely, an \"unanchored\" section of conductor of relatively low mass m much less than M and high mobility (freedom to recoil), then along this portion of the circuit Omega approximate to 0, whereas for the remainder of the circuit, if anchored in the laboratory, Omega approximate to 1. Hence an integral around the whole circuit treats the low-mass portion of the circuit much as if it were an open gap despite the presence of current in it. This proposition is easily put to observational test. By using an electromagnetically driven tuning fork bearing straight segments of current-carrying conductor as sensor (test element), so arranged as to respond to longitudinal force, it has been confirmed through an observed alteration of fork resonance response under ac excitation that a suitably configured weak link in an external closed electrical circuit can, indeed, cause a readily detectable violation of the closed-loop-no-longitudinal-force theorem. In sum, we have exhibited \"cross talk\" between electromagnetic and inertial properties of conducting circuits that can limit the applicability of many of the classical electrodynamic theorems concerning \"closed loops.\" Such theorems are assuredly valid only in the special case of completely immobilized force-exerting circuits, or circuits all parts of which are constrained to prescribed states of motion (not free to recoil).

Unfortunately, in wrong hands, they are also effective medium for spreading social malware and propagation of social botnet. A newly proposed multimedia social network threat, Stegobot masks crucial information in a digital image by using a technique known as steganography. Stegobot works by first infecting a computer and then communicates the stolen information, which could be login passwords, bank account details or credit card numbers. Also it efficiently utilizes the advantage of image steganography to hide the presence of communication within the image sharing behavior of OSNs. Since these social bots exhibit unobservable communication channels, existing botnet detection mechanisms cannot be applied to such botnets. In this paper, we present a novel host based method for detecting and differentiating Stegobot profiles. Also the proposed method shows the ability to detect Stegobot network traffic which is inherently different from legitimate multimedia social network traffic. The best performance of our detection system is demonstrated on different social networks data set with different evaluation metrics. Multiple aspects of multimedia attributes proposed in this study help to explore the hidden communication structure of botnet. Stegobot profiles mimic genuine users and compromise other vulnerable users in social network.

The panel data consist of 29 countries from two different economic levels of countries, 17 developed versus 12 developing countries. The data spanning from 1960 to 2008.

First of all, the estimations are conducted by constructing three different models; First model is estimated by using the original data without any transformation, while the second and third model use the natural logarithm (Log) and inverse form to transform the data. Those two transformation forms are applied to reduce the heteroscedasticity problem. The main findings show a strong relationship between the three variables. The model with inverse function transformation is superior to the other two models using original data and Log transformation, as it has the highest R-2 which illustrates that more than 84% of CO2 emission can be explained by GDP and EC.

The considered IHPS model is comprised of a wind turbine generator, a diesel engine generator and an energy storage device (such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), in this case). Traditionally, SF, membership functions and control rules are obtained in fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) by trial and error method or are obtained based on the experiences of the designers or are optimized by some traditional optimization techniques with some extra computational cost. To overcome all these problems of FLCs, classical controllers have been integrated in this paper with the FLC. QOHS algorithm is applied to simultaneously tune the SFs (the only tunable parameter of FLC), the gains of the classical controllers and the tunable parameters of the SMES device to minimize frequency and power deviations of the studied IHPS system against various load demand and wind change. Different considered controller configurations of the IHPS are SF based FLC (termed as Fuzzy-only), SF based FLC with proportional-integral (PI) (named as Fuzzy-PI) controller, SF based FLC with proportional-derivative (PD) (abbreviated as Fuzzy-PD) controller and SF based FLC with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) (designated as Fuzzy-PID) controller. Simulation results, explicitly, show that the performance of the Fuzzy-PID controller based IHPS is superior to Fuzzy-only, Fuzzy-PI and Fuzzy-PD controller based IHPS configuration in terms of overshoot, settling time and the proposed Fuzzy-PID controller is robust against various wide range of load changes.

E. scolopes has a well-developed circulatory system that allows immune cells (hemocytes) to migrate into tissues, including the light organ and ANG. In the association with V. fischeri, hemocytes are thought to have a number of roles in the management of symbiosis, including the recognition of non-symbiotic bacteria and the contribution of chitin as a nutrient source for V. fischeri. Hemocytes are hypothesized to recognize bacteria through interactions between pattern recognition receptors and microbe-associated molecular patterns. Colonization by V. fischeri has been shown to affect the bacteria-binding behavior, gene expression, and proteome of hemocytes, indicating that the symbiont can modulate host immune function. In the ANG, hemocytes have also been observed interacting with the residing bacterial community. As a model host, E. scolopes offers a unique opportunity to study how the innate immune system interacts with both a binary and consortial symbiosis.

For rectangular structures, they can improve the hydrophobicity with the increase of height and distance ratio h/d of the structures, and the improvement will reach its optimal hydrophobicity when the value h/d is over a certain value of 0.6.

Global cognitive function and functional disability, defined as limitations in mobility, basic (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) were screened in 1991 and 2000. MetS was defined according to the NCEP ATP-III criteria. Results: The study sample consisted of 195 men, baseline age 76.1 +/- 3.1 years. Baseline MetS was prospectively associated with greater 10-year cognitive and functional decline in ADLs and IADLs. After multiple adjustment including age, education, marital status, ApoE epsilon 4 allele, cerebrovascular disease and initial cognitive and depressive status, MetS predicted cognitive decline (B = - 1.684, 95% CI = - 2.202 to - 1.167, p < 0.001) and risk of IADLs (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.20, p = 0.048) and ADLs disability (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12-1.62, p < 0.001). Interestingly, such associations were not attributable to individual altered components of MetS nor to their sum. Incident disability in ADLs and IADLs were not explained by parallel decline in cognitive function.

Also, a general model of normal forces was proposed using the ratio of the normal force to cutting force. Subsequently, the effect of relevant geometrical parameters on the cutting force was discussed. The friction angle between pick and rock, the cone angle and the attack angle were employed to develop the cutting force models of conical picks. The rake angle and the friction angle between pick and rock were included in the peak cutting force model of radial picks. Finally, the peak and mean cutting forces models of conical picks and the peak cutting force model of radial picks under unrelieved cutting mode were developed using principle component regression analysis and ridge regression analysis based on the raw data from linear full-scale cutting test. The results show the proposed regression coefficients and equations are more reasonable physically. Some empirical models used for practical application were then developed by introducing relevant modified coefficients considering tool wear, relieved cutting and complex shapes of picks. The results show a good agreement between the measured and predicted cutting force of sharp picks under unrelieved cutting mode. The performance of modified models using relevant modified coefficients would be decreased to a certain extent. However, they are all statistical valid according to the results of t-test.

BE and PD were calculated from lateral views of the mandibles of mice or of human fetuses using scanned micro-computed tomography (CT) images or alizarin red S-stained specimens, respectively. BE and PD were compared (1) between different developmental stages, and further, to detect abnormalities in the data sets and to evaluate the deviation from normal development in mouse fetuses, (2) at embryonic day (E) 18.5 between the normal and deformed mandibles, the latter being caused by suturing the jaw at E15.5, (3) at E15.5 and E18.5 between normal and knockout mutant mice of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor (Ror) 2. In mice, BE and PD were large during the prenatal period and small after postnatal day 3, suggesting that the mandibular shape changes rapidly during the prenatal and early postnatal periods. In humans, BE of the mandibles peaked at 1619 weeks of gestation, suggesting the time-dependent change in the mandibular shape.

A new set of IFs predicted for the cross section of the Great Belt Bridge (GBB) are discussed. Two approaches, based on the time- and frequency-domain descriptions, are applied. In time domain, IFs are determined by imposing an instantaneous change to a system state variable, e.g., the angle of attack (AOA) of air flow to the bridge section. In frequency domain, indicial representation is derived from the aeroelastic (or flutter) derivatives typically used to define the self-excited harmonic forces in an eigenvalue problem and generated by imposing a sinusoidal motion to the bridge section and performing a sweep in the frequency range of oscillations of the section. IFs are thus evaluated by exploiting the reciprocal relations that exist between them and the aerodynamic derivatives. To determine the aerodynamic response of a bridge cross section due to a step change in the AOA and to calculate the flutter derivatives from sinusoidal oscillations, the meshless discrete vortex method implemented in DVMFLOW (R) is adopted. The results from the proposed work can be applied in the development of reduced-order models (ROM) of aerodynamic loads suitable to investigate fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems associated with practical analysis of wind effects on long-span bridges, including phenomena such as flutter, vortex-induced vibration, buffeting and galloping.

They can be caused by inheritable genetic mutations, acquired somatic mutations, and exposure to toxins (including some prescription medications). Normal mitochondrial physiology is responsible, in part, for the aging process itself, as free radical production within the mitochondria results in a lifetime burden of oxidative damage to DNA, especially the mitochondrial DNA that, in turn, replicate the mutational burden in future copies of itself, and lipid membranes. Primary mitochondrial diseases are those caused by mutations in genes that encode for mitochondrial structural and enzymatic proteins, and those proteins required for mitochondrial assembly and maintenance. A number of common adult maladies are associated with defective mitochondrial energy production and function, including diabetes, obesity, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been demonstrated in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and some cancers. Polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to disease susceptibility, including death from sepsis and survival after head injury. There is considerable overlap in symptoms caused by primary mitochondrial diseases and those illnesses that affect mitochondrial function, but are not caused by primary mutations, as well as disorders that mimic mitochondrial diseases, but are caused by other identified mutations. Evaluation of these disorders is complex, expensive, and not without false-negative and false-positive results that can mislead the physician. Most of the common heritable mitochondrial disorders have been well-described in the literature, but can be overlooked by many clinicians if they are uneducated about these disorders. In general, the evaluation of the classic mitochondrial disorders has become straightforward if the clinician recognized the phenotype and orders appropriate confirmatory testing. However, the majority of patients referred for a mitochondrial evaluation do not have a clear presentation that allows for rapid identification and testing. This article provides introductory comments on mitochondrial structure, physiology, and genetics, but will focus on the presentation and evaluation of adults with mitochondrial symptoms, but who may not have a primary mitochondrial disease.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 12526, "input": "Different criminological theories assume that religiosity protects against violent behavior. Up to now, this assumption is tested empirically almost exclusively for the Christian religiosity. The study presented here questions whether such a relationship between religiosity and violent behavior could be found for Muslims, likewise. Using a German-wide representative school survey of 16,545 male students in the ninth grade, who belong either to a Christian or an Islamic denomination, it can be revealed that only for Christians a higher religiosity correlates with a lower rate of violent behavior. This influence of Christian religiosity can be explained by mainly control theory variables. For Muslims, there is no significant correlation between religiosity and violent behavior in a bivariate analysis. A multivariate analysis, however, reveals a suppression effect: Controlling for alcohol consumption, Muslim religiosity increases violent behavior. In addition, high religious Muslims agree more often to norms of masculinity and consume more often media violence, which are risk factors of violent behavior. Accordingly, it can be concluded that religiosity is not a violence-protecting factor in general; instead, a more differentiated view for separate religious groups is necessary.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 39255, "input": "Theoretical impedance relationships in a limiting process with non-steady-state surface diffusion were derived based on the interfacial conductivity concept at the interface between an oxygen ion conductor and a metallic electrode. While the non-steady-state surface diffusion of adsorbed neutral oxygen on the metallic electrode could be described by Fick's second law, approximated and equivalent equations to the Warburg impedance and Gerischer impedance were derived according to the boundary conditions and occurrence of dissipation by the chemical reaction. The diffusion related to the electrochemical impedance signal is not the diffusion of the oxygen ions. In addition, it is not necessary to assume an electrochemical potential gradient or profile of the free electrons in the metallic electrode. The relationships obtained in this paper indicate that electrochemical potential measured by an instrument is clearly defined by the electrochemical potential of free electrons at the triple phase boundary. The meaning of the equivalent electrical circuits corresponding to the impedance spectra is reconsidered from the view points of the interfacial conductivity concept.

Methods and Results: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical course, genetic testing results, corrected QT interval (QTc), and LQTS score of 59 school-aged children (5-18 years old) with a b-LQT (400 <= QTc= 4.5 points. The genetic testing results were positive in 92%, 57%, and 67% of patients with high, intermediate, and low probabilities of LQTS, respectively. The maximum and mean QTc during the follow-up significantly differed among the categories with a probability of LQTS, but not the minimum QTc. However, the QTc at rest and at the recovery point after exercise stress testing dramatically changed at the last followup. Consequently, the probability of LQTS changed in half of the patients. Conclusions: The LQTS score is a reasonable indicator for evaluating school-aged children with a b-LQT, and patients with a low LQTS score appear to be at low risk for cardiac events. However, the LQTS score can change during follow-up. Therefore, when there is doubt or concern for patients with a b-LQT, it is preferable to continue following them.

This sparks our interest in the fabrication of polycaprolactone (PCL)/ceramic composites for potential use as scaffolds. Diopside, which possesses the most three-dimensional structure among the four, shows the highest mechanical strength and stable structure in physiological solution when added to polycaprolactone in high concentration. In turn, the incorporation of merwinite into composite scaffolds led to materials that had poor mechanical strength and were unstable in physiological environments when ceramic concentration reaches over 50%. Cyto-compatibility and osteogenic studies of the four ceramics revealed that each ceramic is cytocompatible and supports human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) proliferation in stromal medium.

In Streptomyces, most DNA cloning vectors are based on serine integrase site-specific DNA recombination systems derived from phage. Because of their efficiency and simplicity, serine integrases are also used for diverse synthetic biology applications. Here, we present the genome of a new Streptomyces phage, phi Joe, and investigate the conditions for integration and excision of the phi Joe genome. phi Joe belongs to the largest Streptomyces phage cluster (R4-like) and encodes a serine integrase. The attB site from Streptomyces venezuelae was used efficiently by an integrating plasmid, pCMF92, constructed using the phi Joe int-attP locus. The attB site for phi Joe integrase was occupied in several Streptomyces genomes, including that of S. coelicolor, by a mobile element that varies in gene content and size between host species. Serine integrases require a phage-encoded recombination directionality factor (RDF) to activate the excision reaction. The phi Joe RDF was identified, and its function was confirmed in vivo. Both the integrase and RDF were active in in vitro recombination assays. The phi Joe site-specific recombination system is likely to be an important addition to the synthetic biology and genome engineering toolbox. IMPORTANCE Streptomyces spp. are prolific producers of secondary metabolites, including many clinically useful antibiotics. Bacteriophage-derived integrases are important tools for genetic engineering, as they enable integration of heterologous DNA into the Streptomyces chromosome with ease and high efficiency. Recently, researchers have been applying phage integrases for a variety of applications in synthetic biology, including rapid assembly of novel combinations of genes, biosensors, and biocomputing. An important requirement for optimal experimental design and predictability when using integrases, however, is the need for multiple enzymes with different specificities for their integration sites. In order to provide a broad platform of integrases, we identified and validated the integrase from a newly isolated Streptomyces phage, phi Joe. phi Joe integrase is active in vitro and in vivo.

The analytically derived expressions for time-dependent stresses, strains and curvatures are very simple, being gained by a newly proposed relation for the ageing coefficient, constitutive law for creep and the classical formulae of strength of materials. The method proposed is mathematically tractable, as well as accounting for the variation of elastic modulus. A validity of the method proposed was proven by direct calculation of the time-dependent parameters in the analysis of various RC elements. The approach gives exact values of the time-dependent stress strain state as those determined using the age-adjusted effective modulus method involving a sophisticated relaxation procedure. The method does not require the introduction of the fictitious restraining actions dramatically simplifying computation and could be used as a simple alternative approach for the exact analysis of RC uncracked elements.

As T cell distribution at higher resolutions has not been fully investigated, a detailed resolution analysis of T cell distribution was performed. Patient tissues were divided into 10 mu m distance classes between the tumor border and adjacent normal liver. Thereby, distinct density patterns of T cell localization in relation to the malignant tissue could be detected. At a distance of 20 to 30 mu m to the tumor, a decrease of CD3 T cells is common. Within this area, cytotoxic Granzyme B and CD8(+) T cells were found to be significantly reduced as well as CD163 macrophages were increased and identified to be in close contact with T cells. Our data suggests a physical or functional border within this region. Survival analysis revealed improved overall survival in patients with high T cells numbers at the direct tumor border. Interestingly, the decreased T cells in the 20 to 30 mu m region were also found to be significantly associated with improved survival. Consequently, the detailed localization of T cells, despite blockade, could be associated with improved clinical outcome. The high-resolution analysis represents new insights into relevant heterogenous T cell distributions especially related to clinical responses.

With the increasing addition of [C(6)mim]PF6, inerratic fluorescence quenching of FLX solution could be observed from fluorescence spectra. Stern-Volmer constant had negative correlation with temperature. Besides, the addition of [C(6)mirn]PF6 caused a decrease and red-shift of absorption peak in UV-VIS absorption spectra of FLX, which indicated the fluorescence quenching of FLX by [C6mim]PF6 was due to the formation of [C(6)mirn]PF6-FLX complex in the ground state through static quenching procedure.

In these hydrophobic cavities, the H of -CH- adjacent to N of imidazole rings is a potential H-bond donor, and intensive pi electrons in FLX could act as H-bond acceptor, so the FLX entered the hydrophobic cavities of [C6mirn]PF6 due to the interaction of -CH center dot center dot center dot pi type bonds between -CH of [C6(mim)](+) and pi electrons included in FLX.

To date, no studies have examined differences in structural connectivity between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. This study compared fractional anisotropy (FA) and density of selected white matter tracts and amygdala volume between anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed individuals. Methods: 64- direction DTI and T1 scans were collected from 110 unmedicated subjects with MDD, 39 of whom had a co-morbid anxiety disorder diagnosis. Region of interest (ROI) and tractography methods were performed to calculate amygdala volume and FA in the uncinate fasciculus, respectively. Diffusion connectometry was performed to identify whole brain group differences in white matter health. Correlations were computed between biological and clinical measures. Results: Tractography and ROI analyses showed no significant differences between bilateral FA values or bilateral amygdala volumes when comparing the anxious depressed and non-anxious depressed groups. The diffusion connectometry analysis showed no significant differences in anisotropy between the groups. Furthermore, there were no significant relationships between MRI-based and clinical measures. Conclusion: The lack of group differences could indicate that structural connectivity and amygdalae volumes of those with anxious-depression are not significantly altered by a co-morbid anxiety disorder.

The proposed scheme estimates the delay and Doppler parameters sequentially, in which the delay estimation is formulated into a beamspace direction-of-arrival problem and the Doppler estimation is translated into a line spectrum estimation problem. Then the well-known spatial and temporal spectrum estimation techniques are used to provide efficient and high-resolution estimates of the delay and Doppler parameters. In addition, sufficient conditions on the AIC to guarantee the successful estimation of off-grid targets are provided, while the existing conditions are mostly related to the on-grid targets.

Methods: In this observational study, stage IV NSCLC patients tested for EGFR and KRAS mutations were selected, and BM incidence, recurrence and patients' outcome were assessed. Results: A total of 144 patients (142 Caucasian and two Asian) were selected, including 11.27% with EGFR-mutant and 33.10% with KRAS-mutant tumors, and 57.04% patients had developed BM. BM incidence was more frequent in patients with EGFR mutation according to multivariate analyses (MVA) (Odds ratio OR = 8.745 [1.743-43.881], p = 0.008). Among patients with treated BM, recurrence after local treatment was less frequent in patients with KRAS mutation (OR = 0.234 [0.078-0.699], p = 0.009).

These requirements have various characteristics such as extents of importance to the organization, complexity, and dependencies between each other, thereby requiring different effort (workload) to review and clarify. While working with our industrial partners in the domain of CPSs, we discovered an optimization problem, where an optimal solution is required for assigning requirements to various stakeholders by maximizing their familiarity to assigned requirements, meanwhile balancing the overall workload of each stakeholder. In this direction, we propose a fitness function that takes into account all the above-mentioned factors to guide a search algorithm to find an optimal solution. As a pilot experiment, we first investigated four commonly applied search algorithms (i.e., GA, (1 + 1) EA, AVM, RS) together with the proposed fitness function and results show that (1 + 1) EA performs significantly better than the other algorithms. Since our optimization problem is multi-objective, we further empirically evaluated the performance of the fitness function with six multi-objective search algorithms (CellDE, MOCell, NSGA-II, PAES, SMPSO, SPEA2) together with (1 + 1) EA (the best in the pilot study) and RS (as the baseline) in terms of finding an optimal solution using an real-world case study and 120 artificial problems of varying complexity.

These affinities are independent of the number of thiols and are, moreover, lower than those determined for complex formation with Cd2+.

The problem we are interested in is the computation of radiative heat transfer on arbitrarily complex geometries, in particular to characterize thermal loads acting on the surface of space vehicles. Solution method: Our C++ code implements a flexible and efficient Monte Carlo algorithm making use of state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques designed for and validated on arbitrary unstructured meshes. The code is organized as a collection of dynamically linked libraries connected to the computational kernel of the open source COOLFluiD platform. The Monte Carlo method is parallelized through mesh decomposition, while reusing the same partitioned mesh (and associated data structures) on which fluid dynamics equations are solved. Unusual features: The radiation transfer code of COOLFIuiD-MC offers a unique combination of ray tracing algorithms suitable for handling 2D, 2D axisymmetric and 3D simulations on arbitrary unstructured grids.

As a counter-defense, viruses encode silencing suppressor proteins (SSPs) that suppress RNA silencing. Most, but not all, the P0 proteins encoded by poleroviruses have been identified as SSP. In this study, we demonstrated that cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV, genus Polerovirus) P0 protein suppressed local silencing that was induced by sense or inverted repeat transgenes in Agrobacterium co-infiltration assay in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. A CLRDV full-length infectious cDNA clone that is able to infect N. benthamiana through Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation also inhibited local silencing in co-infiltration assays, suggesting that the P0 protein exhibits similar RNA silencing suppression activity when expressed from the full-length viral genome. On the other hand, the P0 protein did not efficiently inhibit the spread of systemic silencing signals. Moreover, Northern blotting indicated that the P0 protein inhibits the generation of secondary but not primary small interfering RNAs. The study of CLRDV P0 suppression activity may contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of cotton blue disease by CLRDV infection. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One reason for this is that a companion dog is likely to elevate positive emotions, which often promote prosocial behavior. In study 1 (n = 120) and study 2 (n = 120), participants were randomly assigned to either a dogpresent or dog-absent four-person group. Three friendly companion dogs were randomly assigned to the dog-present groups; only one dog at a time was used during any given experimental session. In study 1, groups worked on an interactive problem-solving task; participants in the dog-present group displayed more verbal cohesion, physical intimacy, and cooperation.

The hot heavy-water moderator inside the Calandria rises upward due to buoyancy, cooled in a shell and tube heat exchanger (located within the loop) and returns back to the Calandria, completing a natural circulation loop. The heat exchanger, in turn, is cooled by water from a Gravity Driven Water Pool (GDWP); forming a second loop. This coupled natural circulation loop system provides sufficient cooling to prevent the increase of moderator temperature inside the Calandria vessel beyond safe limits during SBO. The feasibility of such a system should be assessed before it is implemented in the reactor. Thus, a scaled test facility was set up to simulate the thermal hydraulic characteristics of the PMCS. A set of time varying power experiments were performed, which capture the flow initiation from rest phenomena and the multidimensional natural convection flow in a coupled natural circulation system. Next, the experimental geometry was simulated using the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code (OpenFoam 2.2.0), which predicted temperature and flow distribution inside the system. The CFD results agree well with the experimental data within +/- 6%. The flow initiation phenomena shows that the initial flow generated recirculates within the Calandria, after similar to 900 s the flow is able to come out of the Calandria.

General trends can be outlined, but the air accumulation zones and two-phase flow patterns are highly dependent on the machine design. The flow regimes vary from a homogeneous distribution of. fine bubbles, evenly dispersed and carried away by the main flow, to more complex flow patterns, especially when the phases separate or the bubbles coalesce forming a gas pocket which adheres to a wide portion of the channel wall. Tests are performed on a multiphase pump laboratory, recently installed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which allows a complete optical access to the pump channels and fine adjustments in the inlet configuration and the tip clearance gap; the air can be injected from different locations producing transient regimes too.

Here we report novel trigenic mutations detected in a Chinese family of obstructive HCM with ER and short QT syndrome (SQTS). Methods: Proband and family members underwent detailed medical assessments. DNAs were extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes for genetic screening with next generation method. The functional characterization of the mutation was conducted in TSA201 cells with patch-clamp experiment. Results: The proband was a 52-year-old male who had a ER pattern ECG in inferioral-lateral leads with atrioventricular block and QTc of 356 ms. He also suffered from severe left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. Targeted sequencing revealed trigenic mutations: c.700G >A/p.E234K in DES, c.2966G >A/p.R989H in MYPN, and c.5918G >C/p.R1973P in CACNA1C. All mutations were also detected in his daughter with ER and mild myocardium hypertrophy. The CACNA1C-R1973P mutation caused significant reduction (68.4%) of I-Ca compared to CACNA1C-WT (n = 14 and 14, P < 0.05). The computer modeling showed that all 3 mutations were highly disease-causing.

Dissociative symptoms are present across a host of neuropsychiatric conditions, including PTSD, psychotic spectrum illnesses, anxiety and mood disorders. Transdiagnostically, the presence of dissociative symptoms is associated with a greater illness burden and reduced treatment outcomes. Critically, dissociative symptoms are related to impaired performance on measures of attention, executive functioning, memory, and social cognition and may contribute to the widespread cognitive dysfunction observed across psychiatric illnesses. Despite this knowledge, the relation between dissociative symptoms and reduced cognitive function remains poorly understood. Here, we review the evidence linking dissociative symptoms to cognitive dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, we explore two potential neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie the relation between dissociative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in trauma-related neuropsychiatric conditions. Specifically, we hypothesize that: 1) functional sensory deafferentation at the level of the thalamus, as observed in the defence cascade model of dissociation, may underlie reduced attention and arousal leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction and; 2) altered functional connectivity between key brain networks implicated in cognitive functioning may represent a critical neurobiological mechanism linking dissociative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in patients with PTSD-DS and transdiagnostically.

Recently, KLF4 was also used in cooperation with other transcription factors to reprogram differentiated cells to pluripotent embryonic stem cell-like cells. Moreover, involvement in oncogenesis was also ascribed to KLF4, which is aberrantly expressed in some types of tumors such as breast, gastric and colon cancer. We previously have shown that Klf4 is strongly expressed in postmeiotic germ cells of mouse and human testes suggesting a role for Klf4 also during spermiogenesis. In order to analyze its function we deleted Klf4 in germ cells using the Cre-loxP system. Homologous recombination of the Klf4 locus has been confirmed by genomic southern blotting and the absence of the protein in germ cells was demonstrated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Despite its important roles in several significant biological settings, deletion of Klf4 in germ cells did not impair spermiogenesis. Histologically, the mutant testes appeared normal and the mice were fertile.

In the AREA (Augmented Reality Engine Application) project, we developed a kernel that enables such location-based mobile augmented reality applications. On top of the kernel, mobile application developers can easily realize their individual applications. The kernel, in turn, focuses on robustness and high performance. In addition, it provides a flexible architecture that fosters the development of individual location-based mobile augmented reality applications. In the first stage of the project, the LocationView concept was developed as the core for realizing the kernel algorithms. This LocationView concept has proven its usefulness in the context of various applications, running on iOS, Android, or Windows Phone. Due to the further evolution of computational capabilities on one hand and emerging demands of location-based mobile applications on the other, we developed a new kernel concept. In particular, the new kernel allows for handling points of interests (POI) clusters or enables the use of tracks. These changes required new concepts presented in this paper. To demonstrate the applicability of our kernel, we apply it in the context of various mobile applications. As a result, mobile augmented reality applications could be run on present mobile operating systems and be effectively realized by engineers utilizing our approach. We regard such applications as a good example for using mobile computational capabilities efficiently in order to support mobile users in everyday life more properly. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Mobile environment for real-time data processing needs some additional aspects besides desktop ones, as the style of mobile app, mobile web and mobile web app. Generally, mobile app provides internal storage service so that offline data processing is possible. But mobile app needs separate development according to different types of devices or operating systems, even to different sizes of display panel of mobile devices. Geo-based data are composed of vector and raster formats from complex structure, compared to other data sets including image data and multimedia data. Hence, even though mobile applications development for geo-based data is more complicated than other ones, users' demands with respect to geo-based data processing functionalities on mobile environment are increasing in these days. Mobile web supported by technical basis of HyperText Markup Language5 (HTML5) is regarded as useful service type combining geo-based data processing modules and mobile environments, because it does not require user' downloading or installation of programs and just needs web browsers. Indexed DB Application Programming Interface (API) within this international web standard provides offline data storage functions on mobile environment. Using this API, data sets can be permanently stored into mobile devices, not cache memory. Among numerous geo-data functionalities, visualization topic is basically and commonly used in most mobile services. This study presents an implementation case of mobile web app with geobased data visualization processing on online and offline mode. Types of geo-based data sets are base map of Open Street Map (OSM), OSM vector layers with Extensible Markup Language (XML) contents and high resolution satellite images of optical sensor.

We aimed at ligand-directed delivery with a suitable target-biomarker to detect early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Promising targets are galectins (Gal), due to their strong expression in and on PDAC-cells and occurrence at early stages in cancer precursor lesions, but not in adjacent normal tissues. Results: Molecular probes (10-29 AA long peptides) derived from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were selected as binding partners to galectins. Affinity constants between the synthesized t-PA peptides and Gal were determined by microscale thermophoresis. The 29 AA-long t-PA-peptide-1 with a lactose-functionalized serine revealed the strongest binding properties to Gal-1 which was 25-fold higher in comparison with the native t-PA protein and showed additional strong binding to Gal-3 and Gal-4, both also over-expressed in PDAC. t-PA-peptide-1 was selected as vector moiety and linked covalently onto the surface of biodegradable iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, CAN-doped maghemite NPs (CAN-Mag), promising as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were selected as magnetic core and coated with different biocompatible polymers, such as chitosan (CAN-Mag-Chitosan NPs) or polylactic co glycolic acid (PLGA) obtaining polymeric nanoparticles (CAN-Mag@PNPs), already approved for drug delivery applications. The binding efficacy of t-PA-vectorized NPs determined by exposure to different pancreatic cell lines was up to 90%, as assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo targeting and imaging efficacy of the vectorized NPs were evaluated by applying murine pancreatic tumor models and assessed by 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The t-PA-vectorized NPs as well as the protease-activated NPs with outer shell decoration (CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac) showed clearly detectable drop of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor staining-intensity indicating a considerable uptake of the injected NPs. Post mortem NP deposition in tumors and organs was confirmed by Fe staining of histopathology tissue sections.

Few studies concerning chronotherapeutics in juvenile depression exist, though the established treatments are insufficient and sleep disorders often co-occur. In this study, we investigate the impact of two types of chronotherapeutics on depressive symptoms and sleep behavior in a juvenile setting. Juvenile inpatients (n = 62) with moderate to severe depressive symptoms took part in either a combined setting consisting of one night wake therapy followed by 2 weeks bright light therapy or in a setting of bright light therapy alone. Depressive symptoms, general psychopathology, clinical impression and sleep behavior were measured before (T1), directly after (T2) and 2 weeks after intervention (T3). Depressive symptoms decreased while sleep quality increased in both groups. The bright light therapy alone group showed further improvement at T3 in regards to depressive symptoms. Correlation analyses indicated significant negative correlations between sleep quality and awaking after restorative sleep with the depressive symptoms. However, only awaking after restorative sleep had a predictive impact on treatment outcome. The present study provides first evidence for a positive impact of chronotherapeutic interventions on treatment outcome in depressed juvenile inpatients.

In addition to its well-known action on brain dopamine, Meth also affects serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate this role in mice, which lack one of the main serotonin receptors, the 5-HT1A receptor, which has been implicated in both schizophrenia and Meth-induced psychosis. Male and female wild-type or 5-HT1A knockout (KO) mice received daily treatment with increasing doses of methamphetamine from 6 to 9 weeks of age (1-4 mg/kg/ day twice a day). At least 2 weeks after the last injection, the mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests focusing on psychosis-related behaviors, including Meth-induced hyperactivity, prepulse inhibition (PPI), social interaction, elevated plus maze (EPM), and Y-maze. Meth pretreatment resulted in significantly increased hyperlocomotion in response to an acute Meth challenge, but this effect was independent of genotype. Chronic Meth treatment resulted in decreased levels of anxiety in the EPM in both sexes, as well as increased startle responses in female mice only, again independent of genotype. 5-HT1A KO mice showed an increased locomotor response to acute Meth in both sexes, as well as increased PPI and decreased startle responses in female mice only, independent of Meth pretreatment.

Methods: Twenty-four healthy participants completed an individually tailored negative mood induction task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessment along with evaluation of ELS. Results: Mood change and amygdala reactivity were increased in never-depressed participants who reported ELS compared to participants who reported no ELS.

We performed a systematic review of the published literature and critically evaluated the evidence for the role of neutrophils, immune complexes (ICs), T-cells, cytokines, and other immunological factors that could contribute to the development of ENL. Searches of the literature were performed in PubMed. Studies, independent of published date, using samples from patients with ENL were included. The search revealed more than 20,000 articles of which 146 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. The studies demonstrate that ENL may be associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate, but it is not clear whether it is an IC-mediated process or that the presence of ICs is an epiphenomenon. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-a and other pro-inflammatory cytokines support the role of this cytokine in the inflammatory phase of ENL but not necessarily the initiation.

This study assessed the effect of itraconazole on the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway and proliferation of human gastric cancer cells. Methods: CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay were used to assess the effects of itraconazole on proliferation of gastric cancer cells. The expression of Hh signaling components in gastric cancer cells treated with itraconazole was evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting and dual luciferase assay. Tumor xenograft models were used to assess the inhibitory effect of itraconazole on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in vivo. Results: Itraconazole could remarkably inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. When in combination with 5-FU, itraconazole significantly reduced the proliferation rate of cancer cells. Furthermore, itraconazole could regulate the G1-S transition and induce apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Hh signaling was abnormally activated in human gastric cancer samples. In vitro, studies showed that the expression of glioma-associated zinc finger transcription factor 1 (Gli1) was decreased at both transcriptional and translational levels after treatment with itraconazole. Dual luciferase assay also indicated that itraconazole could inhibit the transcription of Gli1. In vivo studies demonstrated that monotherapy with itraconazole by oral administration could inhibit the growth of xenografts, and that itraconazole could significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU. Conclusions: Hh signaling is activated in gastric tumor and itraconazole can inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting Gli1 expression.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 16804, "input": "In explaining why constituent groups often vary in their perceptions of the most salient aspects of an organization's identity, existing research has drawn, almost exclusively, on social identity research and self-enhancement motives.

Quantification of cellular oxygen kinetics, i.e. the determination of specific oxygen uptake rates (sOURs), is routinely used to understand metabolic shifts. However current methods to determine sOUR in adherent cell cultures rely on cell sampling, which impacts on cellular phenotype. We present real-time monitoring of cell growth from phase contrast microscopy images, and of respiration using optical sensors for dissolved oxygen. Time-course data for bulk and peri-cellular oxygen concentrations obtained for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) cultures successfully demonstrated this non-invasive and label-free approach. Additionally, we confirmed non-invasive detection of cellular responses to rapidly changing culture conditions by exposing the cells to mitochondrial inhibiting and uncoupling agents. For the CHO and mESCs, sOUR values between 8 and 60 amol cell(-1) s(-1), and 5 and 35 amol cell(-1) s(-1) were obtained, respectively. These values compare favorably with literature data. The capability to monitor oxygen tensions, cell growth, and sOUR, of adherent stem cell cultures, non-invasively and in real time, will be of significant benefit for future studies in stem cell biology and stem cell-based therapies.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 42212, "input": "This research seeks to investigate the antecedents of e-Government adoption in a small island developing state.

METHODS. Impaired vision that spontaneously appeared in newborn lambs was characterized by behavioral, electroretinographic (ERG), and histologic techniques. Deep-sequencing reads of an affected lamb and an unaffected lamb were compared within conserved genomic regions orthologous to human genes involved in similar visual impairment. Observed nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions were classified by their deleteriousness score. The putative causative mutation was assessed by producing compound CNGA3 heterozygotes and applying gene augmentation therapy using the orthologous human cDNA. RESULTS. Behavioral assessment revealed day blindness, and subsequent ERG examination showed attenuated photopic responses. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination of affected sheep eyes did not reveal degeneration, and cone photoreceptors expressing CNGA3 were present. Bioinformatics and sequencing analyses suggested a c. 1618G>A, p. Gly540Ser substitution in the GMP-binding domain of CNGA3 as the causative mutation. This was confirmed by genetic concordance test and by genetic complementation experiment: All five compound CNGA3 heterozygotes, carrying both p. Arg236* and p. Gly540Ser mutations in CNGA3, were day-blind. Furthermore, subretinal delivery of the intact human CNGA3 gene using an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) restored photopic vision in two affected p. Gly540Ser homozygous rams. CONCLUSIONS. The c. 1618G>A, p. Gly540Ser substitution in CNGA3 was identified as the causative mutation for a novel form of ACHM in Awassi sheep. Gene augmentation therapy restored vision in the affected sheep. This novel mutation provides a large-animal model that is valid for most human CNGA3 ACHM patients; the majority of them carry missense rather than premature-termination mutations.", "class": "Computer Science"}, {"id": 40487, "input": "This paper describes the second part of a series of investigation to develop algorithms for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol parameters and surface reflectance from the future hyperspectral and geostationary satellite sensors such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO). The information content in these hyperspectral measurements is analyzed for 6 principal components (PCs) of surface spectra and a total of 14 aerosol parameters that describe the columnar aerosol volume V-total fine-mode aerosol volume fraction, and the size distribution and wavelength-dependent index of refraction in both coarse and fine mode aerosols. Forward simulations of atmospheric radiative transfer are conducted for 5 surface types (green vegetation, bare soil, rangeland, concrete and mixed surface case) and a wide range of aerosol mixtures. It is shown that the PCs of surface spectra in the atmospheric window channel could be derived from the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance in the conditions of low aerosol optical depth (AOD <= 0.2 at 550 nm), with a relative error of 1%. With degree freedom for signal analysis and the sequential forward selection method, the common bands for different aerosol mixture types and surface types can be selected for aerosol retrieval. The first 20% of our selected bands accounts for more than 90% of information content for aerosols, and only 4 PCs are needed to reconstruct surface reflectance. However, the information content in these common bands from each TEMPO individual observation is insufficient for the simultaneous retrieval of surface's PC weight coefficients and multiple aerosol parameters (other than V-total). In contrast, with multiple observations for the same location from TEMPO in multiple consecutive days, 1-3 additional aerosol parameters could be retrieved. Consequently, a self adjustable aerosol retrieval algorithm to account for surface types, AOD conditions, and multiple-consecutive observations is recommended to derive aerosol parameters and surface reflectance simultaneously from TEMPO. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper deeply investigates the capabilities of a synchronous reluctance motor and compares them with those of a permanent-magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motor, according to the typical requirement of a traction application. A proper rotor design is necessary. The average torque is due to the rotor anisotropy. The permeance difference between the directand the quadrature-axis is achieved by means of a high number of flux barriers. The position of the flux barrier ends and proper rotor asymmetries are chosen so as to reduce the torque ripple, mainly due to the slot harmonics. The impact of the rotor design on the motor performance is presented deeply, showing several simulation and experimental results, carried out on synchronous reluctance motors with different rotor geometries. Permanent magnets can be inset in the flux barriers to assist the synchronous reluctance motor improving its capabilities, but avoiding to use rare-earth permanent magnets. The main advantages of the permanent magnet assistance is an increase of the main torque density and of the power factor. They are evaluated experimentally.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of prefabricated surgical resection templates used in mandibular segmental resections in comparison to the virtual surgical plan. Materials and methods: A prospective study was performed in 11 consecutive patients, with a primary T4 oral squamous cell carcinoma or osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. Preoperatively, a CBCT scan was acquired to delineate the size and extension of tumor invasion; a virtual patient-specific resection template was designed based on this information. Intraoperatively, the resection template was positioned on the mandible and secured using four fixation screws. Postoperatively, a CBCT scan was acquired. This scan was superimposed on the preoperative scan. Positioning of the resection template and inclination of the resection planes were evaluated on the virtual head model. In order to test the interobserver reliability of these new measurement methods, two different observers executed all measurements. Results: The mean shift of the proximal resection templates was 3.76 mm (standard deviation [SD] 3.10 mm). For the distal resection templates, the mean shift was 3.06 mm (SD 1.57 mm) with no significant interobserver difference (ICC = 0.99). An absolute mean deviation of 8.5 degrees (SD 5.3 degrees) was found for the proximal resection angle and 10.4 degrees (SD 5.0 degrees) for the distal resection angle. Again, no significant interobserver differences were found (ICC = 0.98). Conclusion: The resection templates used in this study proved reasonably accurate. Although the concept of virtual surgical planning aids significantly in mandibular reconstruction with microvascular free flaps, further improvement of resection accuracy is necessary for further improvement of reconstruction accuracy.

Specifically, KPSR first uses patch sparse representations to get the patch score of each patch. Second, KPSR proposes a selection criterion of key patch to judge the patches within the bounding box and select the key patch according to its location and occlusion case. Third, KPSR designs the corresponding contribution factor for the sampled patches to emphasize the contribution of the selected key patches.

In this paper, we propose a novel image keypoint descriptor, namely local derivative quantized binary pattern for object recognition. To incorporate the spatial information, we first divide the local affine covariant region into several subregions according to the intensity orders. For each sub region, we quantize the intensity differences between the central pixels and their neighbors in an adaptive way, and then we order the differences and use a hash function to map the differences into binary codes. The binary codes are histogramed to form the feature of each subregion. Furthermore, we utilize multi-scale support regions and pool the histograms together to represent the features of the image. Our approach does not need prior codebook training and hence it is more flexible and easy to be implemented. Moreover, our descriptor can preserve more local brightness and edge information than the traditional binary descriptors. Also, our descriptor is robust to rotation, illumination variations and other geometric transformations.

Alternative NSAID such as weak COX-I inhibitors or selective COX-II inhibitors are sometimes not sufficiently effective or have potentially troublesome adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: To date, prophylactic premedication with H-1-antihistamines is rarely practiced in patients concurrently suffering from recurrent pain and NSAID-associated urticaria. Our data analysis aims to clarify whether prophylactic premedication before the intake of NSAID is effective, safe, and practicable. METHODS: Data of 21 patients with NSAID-induced or NSAID-exacerbated urticaria who underwent single dose NSAID provocation 30 minutes after premedication with 5 mg desloratadine were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: After H-1-antihistamine premedication, 17 patients tolerated 16 single dose provocation tests with strong COX-I inhibitors and 2 tests with weak COX-I inhibitors.

The lipid composition of secreted lipoproteins was also influenced by fatty acid treatment, resulting in significantly smaller lipoprotein particles secreted by cells preincubated with elaidic acid and CLA compared with those secreted by cells treated with oleic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. Our results are relevant to human metabolism for the following reasons: (1) the size of plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) is determined, at least in part, by the composition of apoB-containing lipoproteins secreted by the liver; (2) small plasma LDL particles are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease; and (3) specific dietary fatty acids can affect the composition and size of plasma LDLs, thereby imparting a relative atherogenicity to plasma LDLs independent of LDL cholesterol concentration.

The MRCPSP problem is known to be nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) and has been solved using various exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic procedures. In this paper, constraint programming (CP) is used as an advanced mathematical optimization technique that suits scheduling problems. The IBM ILOG modeling software and its CPLEX-CP solver engine have been used to develop a CP optimization model for the MRCPSP problem. Unlike many metaheuristic methods in literature, the CP model is fast and provides a near-optimum solution to the MRCPSP for projects with hundreds of activities within minutes. The paper compares the CP results with two case studies from the literature to prove the practicality and usefulness of the CP approach to both researchers and practitioners. One case study was used as the basis for creating larger projects with up to 2,000 activities. The results reported in this paper can be used as a benchmark for other researchers to compare and improve.

The mechanisms proposed to explain, at the microscopic scale, the cracking propagation processes are not able to elucidate all aspects of this phenomenon in different metal/environment systems. This work is concerned with the development of a new multiphysics model for understanding the phenomena of crack propagation under the effect of SCC. This new model is based upon: (i) a phase field method, based on a variational formulation of brittle fracture with regularized approximation of discontinuities; (ii) a robust algorithm capable to prescribe the displacements (over the boundary of a small sub-volume) and crack onset obtained by image processing based on digital image correlation in the sample during the numerical simulations; (iii) a coupling with a diffusion model informed with first-principles computations of diffusion coefficient. In this new model, the phenomenon of environmentally assisted cracking phenomena was successfully represented as well the interactions between cracks and the subsequent shielding effects. The analyses, performed on several samples of Inconel 600 alloy containing a crack network, show a remarkable agreement between the crack morphology and history obtained by the model and by the experiments.

The basic genetic mechanisms leading to increased enzyme content in cancer cells were investigated using cell lines derived from human metastatic breast carcinomas (T47D, Zr75 and SKBr3) and normal human breast epithelium (184A1). Materials and Methods: Western analysis, Northern blotting, [2-C-14]malonyl-CoA incorporation assays, nuclear run-off transcription assays, mRNA decay assays, and poly(A) tail assays were used to measure and compare transcription rates of the FAS gene among the four cell lines. Results: By Western analysis, FAS levels in T47D were 2.6 times lower than ZR75 and SK-Br3, but 6.7 times greater than non-neoplastic 184A1 cells. FAS mRNA levels and specific activity correlated with protein content. In contrast, relative rates of FAS gene transcription were significantly higher in non-neoplastic 184A1 cells than T47D, ZR75 and SKBr3. Stability of message was investigated to explain this discrepancy. The half-life of FAS mRNA in 184A1 cells was 5.6 h, or 4-5-fold less than ZR75 and SKBr3. Poly(A) tail assays showed that FAS mRNA species from 184A1 cells tended to be longer than those of breast cancer cell lines (500-1500 nt versus 500-800 nt, respectively). Conclusion: Breast cancer cell lines contained significantly more FAS enzyme, message and activity than nonneoplastic 184A1 cells. Yet, 184A1 cells exhibited higher rates of FAS gene activation. The discrepancy is explained by faster decay of FAS message in 184A1 cells, suggesting that stabilization of FAS mRNA plays a major role in overexpression of the protein in breast cancer. Increased stability could not be explained simply by degree of polyadenylation. Therefore, some other mechanism (s) must be responsible for conferring stability to FAS RNA species in breast cancer cells.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 17872, "input": "In this article, we explore the different roles that knowledge sharing and exploitative learning play in employees' innovative behaviour, and investigate the different moderating effects of employees' espoused national cultural values on the relationship between exploitative learning and innovative behaviour in the Chinese IT-enabled global service firms with different ownerships.

An internal model of a reference sinusoidal signal is included with the augmented plant model and an integrator is introduced with a linear quadratic Gaussian controller which reduces the phase error between the input and output sinusoids. The proposed method allows a commercial AFM to scan at high scanning speeds as an alternative to the raster scanning approach.

The raster scanned images obtained using the standard AFM PI controller is also presented for comparison with the spiral images. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioner-The main motivation for this work is to propose a control system for high-speed imaging using an AFM. The scanning speed of a commercial AFM is limited by the positioning accuracy of the scanner. The scanner is made of a piezoelectric tube actuator. The commercially available scanners have the following problems: 1) creep effect at slow speed scanning; 2) hysteresis effect during large range scanning (these two effects result in inaccurate reference motion tracking); and 3) vibration effect at high frequencies due to its mechanical flexibility. To overcome these limitations, an internal reference model-based linear quadratic Gaussian control approach is designed and experimentally implemented using the dSPACE ds-1103 real-time prototype system. Before the control design, the scanner is modelled (experimentally) by using a system identification method, and a vibration compensator is incorporated with the identified model. Apart from the control design, a spiral motion of the scanner is considered instead of a well-known raster scanning which is adopted in all commercial AFMs. The designed controller is applied in the piezoelectric tube scanner experimentally, and the obtained results are presented in terms of tracking accuracy, damping of scanners vibration, and generating high-quality images as compared with the existing commercially available methods.

In addition to 9 months required to deplete antioxidants (Stage I), the tests indicated a lag period (Stage II) of 5.5 months and a time from the start of degradation to rupture (Stage III) of 20 months, giving a total inferred time to rupture of 34.5 months (2.9 years). There were up to 61 brittle ruptures per sample (i.e. >2 million cracks per hectare). The ruptures were predominately oriented in the machine direction and located (1) directly beneath a gravel contact, (2) at the side of a gravel indentation, or (3) between gravel indentations. The ruptures between gravel indentations were the least frequent but largest. The calculated strains perpendicular to the rupture direction were 24 +/- 6%. Rupture occurred, although the average stress-crack resistance for all ruptured geomembrane samples still was approximately 760 +/- 200 h, with a minimum of 360 h. These results indicate the importance of minimizing tensile strains in the geomembrane in the design of a liner system.

It has a single-cell rectangular box girder with a wide top flange supported by regularly spaced inclined struts. Aeroelastic studies of this precise type of deck seem nonexistent in the literature.

Excessive application of N-fertilizers and the associated underground water contamination have attracted a great deal of research attention. Sorption is efficient and environmentally friendly in nitrate fixation. A debate was noted in literature regarding whether biochars have potential to fix nitrate through sorption. In this study, biochars produced from different biomasses as well as biomass compositions were chosen as the absorbents to evaluate their potential efficiencies in nitrate fixation. Increased sorption to nitrate was observed for biochars with increased pyrolysis temperature, but the increasing extent varied with biomass. The surface base functional groups and surface charges of biochars could not well explain nitrate sorption. The significant positive correlation between nitrate sorption and biochar surface areas suggested that surface area was the controlling parameter for nitrate sorption. The pre-coating of tannic acid (TA) on biochars decreased but did not completely inhibit nitrate sorption. This observation suggested that nitrate sorption on biochars may be further decreased after their interactions with natural organic matter. Nitrate sorption was compared among various adsorbents, including biochars, soil particles, clay minerals, engineered particles, as well as humic substances. Soil particles generally showed high sorption to nitrate over biochars. This result suggested that biochars investigated in this work may play a limited role in nitrate fixation through sorption after their massive application. Nitrogen fixation through nitrate adsorption on biochars should be carefully evaluated taking into consideration of biochar feedstocks and properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main novelty of the system is that it tackles the imbalanced nature of the dataset by considering semi-supervised learning, analysing its potential for obtaining more robust and equitable models in liver transplantation. We propose two different sources of unsupervised data for this specific problem (recent transplants and virtual donor-recipient pairs) and two methods for using these data during model construction (a semi-supervised algorithm and a label propagation scheme). The virtual pairs and the label propagation method are shown to alleviate the imbalanced distribution. The results of our experiments show that the use of synthetic and real unsupervised information helps to improve and stabilise the performance of the model and leads to fairer decisions with respect to the use of only supervised data. Moreover, the best model is combined with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD), which is at the moment the most popular assignation methodology worldwide. By doing this, our decision-support system considers both the compatibility of the donor and the recipient (by our prediction system) and the recipient severity (via the MELD score), supporting then the principles of fairness and benefit.

Results: The patient and control groups had similar demographic measures, intelligence, and mean olfaction scores, but significantly differed in social domains, including adjustment, function, and anxiety. Odor detection sensitivity showed significantly opposite correlations for the depressive and manic mood domains in bipolar disorder (r to z = 2.83, p = 0.005). Depressive symptoms were related to increased sensitivity (the ability to detect odors at a lower concentration) and mania symptoms were related to decreased sensitivity for odor detection.

In this mechanism, the deep auto-encoder network is introduced as basic classifier to identify data type. In hierarchical training of the auto-encoder, a training method based on cross-entropy loss function and back-propagation algorithm is proposed to overcome the problem of weights updating too slow by the traditional variance cost function, and the momentum factors are added to improve the convergence performance. Meanwhile, in the stage of fine-tuning and classification of the deep network, an active online sampling algorithm is proposed to select the sample online for updating the network weights, so as to eliminate redundancy of the total samples, balance the amounts of all sample types, and improve the classification accuracy of small sample.

Nowadays, most of the general contractors tend to sublet the large portions of construction works to subcontractors and they only act as construction management agencies. In other words, while subcontractors carry out the actual production work, general contractors organize and coordinate the subcontractors and control their works in terms of time, cost and quality. in the construction industry, since the general contractors are responsible to the owners for the works carded out by the subcontractors, the general contractors should select the most appropriate subcontractors for the work packages that constitute the entire project. In the literature, there are a great number of studies that focus on subcontractor selection practices in the construction industry. These studies can mainly be categorized into two groups, which are; 1) the studies that aim to identify the subcontractor selection criteria and their importance levels, and 2) the studies that aim to propose tools, techniques and/or methodologies for subcontractor selection. The common point of the studies in the second category is that they all focus on selecting the most appropriate subcontractor for one work package in the project. For instance, if the case is the airport construction project, the construction of car park may be one work package. In this study, selection of subcontractors for the all work packages in a constniction project is made using genetic algorithm technique considering time, cost and quality performances. A real-life construction project is selected as a case study and the actual data regarding alternative subcontractors arc collected. The subcontractors for all work packages were selected successfully using the genetic algorithm technique. (C) 2015 The Authors.

It strongly endorses the viewpoint that selective modifications of \"marks\" on DNA and histones constitute the crucial codes of life, a proposition which is hotly contested (Ptashne et al., in 2010). This proposition reflects the current mindset that DNA and histone modifications are the prime movers in gene regulation during evolution. This claim is perplexing, since the well characterized organisms., Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack methylated DNA \"marks\" and the DNA methytransferase enzymology. Despite their complete absence, D. melanogaster nevertheless has extensive gene regulatory networks which drive sophisticated development, gastrulation, migration of germ cells and yield a nervous system with significant neural attributes. In stark contrast, the honey bee Apis mellifera deploys its human-type DNA methyltransferase enzymology to \"mark\" its DNA and it too has sophisticated development. What roles therefore is DNA methylation playing in different animals? The honey bee brings a fresh perspective to this question. Its combinatorial chemistry of pheromones, tergal and cuticular exudates provide an exquisite communication system between thousands of individuals. The development of queen and worker is strictly controlled by differential feeding of royal jelly and their adult behaviors are accompanied by epigenomic changes. Their interfaces with different \"environments\" are extensive, allowing an evaluation of the roles of epigenomes in behavior in a natural environment, in the space of a few weeks, and at requisite levels of experimental rigor.

Remotely-sensed Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) are promising predictors for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) by offering an early and integrative response of vegetation performance to environmental drivers. Species of high conservation concern would benefit the most from a better ability to anticipate changes in habitat suitability. Here we illustrate how yearly projections from SDMs based on EFAs could reveal short-term changes in potential habitat suitability, anticipating mid-term shifts predicted by climate-change-scenario models. We fitted two sets of SDM5 for 41 plant species of conservation concern in the Iberian Peninsula: one calibrated with climate variables for baseline conditions and projected under two climate-change-scenarios (future conditions); and the other calibrated with EFAs for 2001 and projected annually from 2001 to 2013. Range shifts predicted by climate-based models for future conditions were compared to the 2001-2013 trends from EFAs-based models. Projections of EFAs-based models estimated changes (mostly contractions) in habitat suitability that anticipated, for the majority (up to 64%) of species, the mid-term shifts projected by traditional climate-change scenario forecasting, and showed greater agreement with the business-as-usual scenario than with the sustainable-development one. This study shows how satellite-derived EFAs can be used as meaningful essential biodiversity variables in SDM5 to provide early-warnings of range shifts and predictions of short-term fluctuations in suitable conditions for multiple species.

Electric vehicle (EV) and electric water heater (EWH) are incorporated in the HEMS. They are controllable appliances with storage capability. EVs are flexible energy-intensive loads, which can provide advantages of a dispatchable source. It is expected that the penetration of EVs will grow considerably in future. This algorithm is designed for a smart household with a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system integrated with an energy storage system (ESS). Simulation results are presented under different pricing and DR programs to demonstrate the application of the HEMS and to verify its' effectiveness. Case studies are conducted using real measurements. They consider the household load, the rooftop PV generation forecast and the built-in parameters of controllable appliances as inputs. The results exhibit that the daily household energy cost reduces 29.5%-31.5% by using the proposed optimization-based algorithm in the HEMS instead of a simple rule-based algorithm under different pricing schemes.

The recent introduction of the second- generation Kinect, which is based on the time-of-flight measurement principle, brought to the robotics and computer vision researchers a sensor that overcomes some of these limitations. However, as the new Kinect is, just like the older one, intended for computer games and human motion capture rather than for navigation, it is unclear how much the navigation methods, such as visual odometry and SLAM, can benefit from the improved parameters.

The coveted increase in railway share of transport demand for the next decades and the attempt to open up the rail market (for freight, international and recently also local services) strengthen the attention to capacity usage of the system. This contribution proposes a synthetic methodology for the capacity and utilisation analysis of complex interconnected rail networks; the procedure has a dual scope since it allows both a theoretically robust examination of suburban rail systems and a solid approach to be applied, with few additional and consistent assumptions, for feasibility or strategic analysis of wide networks (by efficiently exploiting the use of Big Data and/or available Open Databases). Method In particular the approach proposes a schematization of typical elements of a rail network (stations and line segments) to be applied in case of lack of more detailed data; in the authors' opinion the strength points of the presented procedure stem from the flexibility of the applied synthetic methods and from the joint analysis of nodes and lines. The article, after building a quasiautomatic model to carry out several analyses by changing the border conditions or assumptions, even presents some general abacuses showing the variability of capacity/utilization of the network's elements in function of basic parameters. Results This has helped in both the presented case studies: one focuses on a detailed analysis of the Naples' suburban node, while the other tries to broaden the horizon by examining the whole European rail network with a more specific zoom on the Belgium area. The first application shows how the procedure can be applied in case of availability of fine-grained data and for metropolitan/regional analysis, allowing a precise detection of possible bottlenecks in the system and the individuation of possible interventions to relieve the high usage rate of these elements. The second application represents an on-going attempt to provide a broad analysis of capacity and related parameters for the entire European railway system. It explores the potentiality of the approach and the possible exploitation of different 'Open and Big Data' sources, but the outcomes underline the necessity to rely on proper and adequate information; the accuracy of the results significantly depend on the design and precision of the input database. Conclusion In conclusion, the proposed methodology aims to evaluate capacity and utilisation rates of rail systems at different geographical scales and according to data availability; the outcomes might provide valuable information to allow efficient exploitation and deployment of railway infrastructure, better supporting policy (e.g. investment prioritization, rail infrastructure access charges) and helping to minimize costs for users. The presented case studies show that the method allows indicative evaluations on the use of the system and comparative analysis between different elementary components, providing a first identification of 'weak' links or nodes for which, then, specific and detailed analyses should be carried out, taking into account more in depth their actual configuration, the technical characteristics and the real composition of the traffic (i.e. other elements influencing the rail capacity, such as: the adopted operating systems, the station traffic/route control & safety system, the elastic release of routes, the overlap of block sections, etc.).", "class": "Computer Science"}, {"id": 25221, "input": "Objective: To investigate the extent and reasons contributing to discrepancies between those receiving a DSM as against a clinical diagnosis of a bipolar disorder (BP) and/or a borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Rates of BPD allocation varied marginally, with discordance mostly arising from so clinically diagnosed receiving a comorbid BP/BPD DSM diagnosis. Finally, DSM overestimated comorbidity compared with clinician diagnoses.

Literature review: The purpose of the literature review is to examine the current literature in the areas of national culture, medium type and first impression bias reduction, especially in a communication context. Researchers reviewed the discussions on first impression formation, and national culture theories, and the Media Richness Theory. For media, multimedia type was found to reduce first impression bias more than text medium type. For national culture, the literature review suggested that national culture dimensions (such as collectivism, assertiveness, and uncertainty avoidance) could possibly affect first impression bias reduction. Methodology: The researchers conducted a quantitative experiment with 407 students from a US university and a Chinese university, who majored in business-related disciplines. Researchers requested the treatment group participants to access performance bias cue. The participants then performed an initial appraisal of a manager based on Denison's leadership index. The participants then viewed the job interview of the manager, via different media, and performed the appraisal again. The performance appraisal data were collected via a website. The researchers used Analysis of Variance to analyze the data. Results and discussion: This study found that for our participants, national culture reduces first impression bias more than media.

Such expectations can lead to unconscious biases in our perception that are particularly evident when sensory evidence is uncertain. We illustrate the ideas with reference to our recent studies on gaze perception which show that people have a bias to perceive the gaze of others as directed towards themselves.

Domestic rainwater harvesting systems provide a variety of benefits for water management and contribute to sustainable and integrated urban water management. There are however risks associated with rainwater harvesting that requires appropriate mitigation. One such risk is that systems can become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. This can constitute a significant health risk through the spread of mosquito-borne diseases (i.e. arbovirus and malaria). This paper explores the extent to which mosquitoes breed in rainwater harvesting systems as well as the effectiveness of different risk mitigation actions. Data were sourced from a large-scale domestic rainwater tank inspection survey undertaken in Melbourne and were analysed using simple Bayesian Network models. The observed rate of mosquito breeding was too high and was identified as a serious concern for health officials and water managers. The most common access routes into the tank system were found to be through the tank inlet or overflow. By exploring different system set-ups it was found that in order to mitigate the risk of mosquito breeding in tanks, all potential access routes must be adequately sealed. The complete eradication of mosquitos in rainwater tanks, however, may need further investigation, as 4% of systems with adequate protection at the inlet and overflow were still found to have mosquitoes in them.

Previously, we showed that subclinical maternal hypothyroidism leads to premature atresia of ovarian follicles in female rat offspring in the pre-pubertal and pubertal periods. The influence of decreased concentration of TH on primordial follicles pool formation during neonatal and early infantile period of rat pups was not investigated previously. Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy has irreversible negative influence on primordial follicles pool formation and population of resting oocytes in female rat offspring. The study was done on neonatal and early infantile control (n-10) and hypothyroid (n-10) female rat pups derived from control (n-6) and propylthiouracil (PTU) treated pregnant dams (n-6), respectively. Ovaries of all pups were removed and processed for light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Number of nests, oogonia and oocytes per nest, primordial, primary, secondary and preantral follicles were determined. Screening for overall calcium presence in ovarian tissue was done using Alizarin red staining. Morphology and volume density of nucleus, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER) in the oocytes in primordial follicles was also assessed. Caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL), both markers for apoptosis, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for proliferation were determined in oocytes and granulosa cells in different type of follicles. In neonatal period, ovaries of hypothyroid pups had a decreased number of oogonia, oocytes and nests, an increased number of primordial follicles and a decreased number of primary and secondary follicles, while in early infantile period, increased number of primary, secondary and preantral follicles were found. Alizarin red staining was intense in hypothyroid neonatal rats that also had the highest content of dilated sER. Number of mitochondria with altered morphology in both groups of hypothyroid pups was increased. Apoptosis markers have not shown significant difference between groups but PCNA had an increased expression in the oocytes and granulosa cells in primordial follicles of hypothyroid rats. Light and electron microscopy analysis indicate that previously detected premature ovarian follicular atresia in pre-pubertal and pubertal hypothyroid rats is preceded with premature formation of primordial follicles followed by slight changes on sER and mitochondria in examined oocytes, and increased expression of PCNA.

The tandem structure of perovskite-silicon solar cells is a promising method to achieve efficient solar energy conversion at low cost. In the four-terminal tandem configuration, the cells are connected independently and hence avoids the need for current matching between top and bottom subcell, thus giving greater design flexibility. The simulation analysis shows, PCE of 27.6% and 22.4% with 300 mu m and 10 pm thick rear contact Si bottom subcell, respectively.

AHAS is the first enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway that produces the branched-chain of the essential amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Therefore, multiple copies of the AHAS gene might be of interest for breeding programs targeting herbicide resistance. In this work, the characterization of the AHAS gene was accomplished for the Chenopodium quinoa Regalona-Baer cultivar. Cloning, sequencing, and Southern blotting were conducted to determine the number of gene copies. Results: The presence of multiple copies of the AHAS gene as has been shown previously in several other species is described. Six copies of the AHAS gene were confirmed with Southern blot analyses. CqHAS1 and CqAHAS2 variants showed the highest homology with AHAS mRNA sequences found in the NR Database. A third copy, CqAHAS3, shared similar fragments with both CqAHAS1 and CqAHAS2, suggesting duplication through homeologous chromosomes pairing. Conclusions: The presence of multiple copies of the gene AHAS shows that gene duplication is a common feature in polyploid species during evolution.

The qRT-PCR, western blot and the luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm Rab27B as the target of miR-20a-5p. In addition, the roles of miR-20a-5p in NPC radio-resistance were detected by transfection of either miR-20a-5p-mimic or miR-20a-5p-antagomiR. The involvement of Rab27B with NPC radio-resistance was also detected by the experiments with siRNA-mediated repression of Rab27B or over-expression of GFP-Rab27B. Wound healing and invasion assays were performed to detect the roles of both miR-20a-5p and Rab27B. Results: MiR-20a-5p promotes NPC radio-resistance. We identified that its target gene Rab27B negatively correlates with miR-20a-5p-mediated NPC radio-resistance by systematic studies of a radio-sensitive (CNE-2) and resistant (CNE-1) NPC cell lines. Repression of Rab27B by siRNA suppresses cell apoptosis and passivates CNE-2 cells, whereas overexpression of Rab27B triggered cell apoptosis and sensitizes CNE-1 cells.

Moreover, virtually nothing is known about the development of false memories beyond delays of about 12 h. Here, for the first time, we assess post-sleep development of true and false memories across longer delay intervals of 24 and 48 h. Although technically a false memory, remembering information that is related to the theme, or gist, of an experience can be considered an adaptive process. Some evidence suggests that sleep, compared to a wake period, increases both true and gist-based false memories in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) task, but not all studies have returned this result, and most studies cannot rule out the possibility that sleep is merely protecting the information from interference, as opposed to actively aiding its consolidation. Here, to equate amount of time spent awake and asleep across groups, we assess how the positioning of sleep relative to memory encoding impacts retention across longer delays of 24 and 48 h. Participants encoded 16 DRM lists in the morning (WAKE 1st Groups) or evening (SLEEP 1st Groups), and were tested either 24 or 48 h later at the same time of day. Results demonstrate that true memory is better when participants sleep soon after learning. Sleeping first also increased false memory, but only in low performers.

The nature of its clinical manifestations, including severe mood swings, can be a significant stressor for caregivers. The patient's relatives may experience severe distress, which impinges on the overall family functioning and may even lead to family disruption. In turn, it is well established that family functioning may have a marked impact on the course and outcome of chronic mental illness. Relevant studies led to the development of psychosocial interventions as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, initially addressing the families of patients with schizophrenia. Currently such forms of psychosocial interventions, of which the psychoeducational approach is the most usual, are widely implemented with families of patients with BD and can achieve a satisfactory outcome in its life-long management. Psychoeducation provides the patient's family with essential knowledge about the illness and its treatment, along with training in communication and problem solving skills. Psychoeducational interventions support the caregivers in coping effectively with the problematic behavior of the patient with BD and the challenges of care. Improvement in the family atmosphere, development of effective coping strategies and alleviation of the burden on the caregivers all constitute crucial determinants of the overall therapeutic outcome.

Kindergarten children from low SES households, those raised by mothers with depressive symptoms or experiencing emotional problems or substance abuse, or those who were punished by spanking were significantly more likely to later display severe levels of ADHD-CD symptomatology in eighth grade. Kindergarten children frequently engaging in ADHD-CD-type behaviors were more likely to later experience both moderate (covariate adjusted OR = 2.37) and severe (covariate adjusted OR = 3.63) ADHD-CD symptomatology.

But in the mechanical, industrial and manufacturing engineering (MIME) capstone design course at Oregon State University, incorporating an individual writing experience is necessitated by its status as the designated writing-intensive (WI) course for MIME majors. As such, and despite its large size (typically 100-140 students), the course must satisfy the associated university-wide WI requirements-including the specification that individual writing accounts for at least 25% of students' final course grade.

Rhythm dysfunctions have been observed in mood disorder patients by using actigraphic measures and by assessing social metric rhythms, diurnal preferences and melatonin secretion. Since many of these markers are heritable and therefore driven by clock genes, these genes may represent susceptibility factors for mood spectrum disorders. Indeed, several genetic association studies have suggested that certain circadian gene variants play a role in susceptibility to these disorders. Such connections to circadian genes such as CLOCK, ARNTL1, NPAS2, PER3 and NR1D1 have been repeatedly demonstrated for bipolar disorders, and to a lesser extent for recurrent depressive disorders and seasonal affective disorders.

During final incubation precocial bird embryos have all the prerequisites to respond to environmental (temperature) influences in a nearly appropriate way. Autonomic, neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of endothermy are established and the transition of the thermoregulatory system from a control system without feedback into a system with feedback mechanisms occurs.

These traits are also expressed in probands at high genetic risk of BD. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is a key cortical hub in the circuits of emotion and cognitive control, and it has been frequently associated with BD. Here, we studied resting-state functional connectivity of the left IFG in participants with BD and in those at increased genetic risk. METHODS: Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging we compared 49 young BD participants, 71 individuals with at least one first-degree relative with BD (at-risk), and 80 control subjects. We performed between group analyses of the functional connectivity of the left IFG and used graph theory to study its local functional network topology. We also used machine learning to study classification based solely on the functional connectivity of the IFG. RESULTS: In BD, the left IFG was functionally dysconnected from a network of regions, including bilateral insulae, ventrolateral prefrontal gyri, superior temporal gyri, and the putamen (p < .001). A small network incorporating neighboring insular regions and the anterior cingulate cortex showed weaker functional connectivity in at-risk than control participants (p < .006). These constellations of regions overlapped with frontolimbic regions that a machine learning classifier selected as predicting group membership with an accuracy significantly greater than chance.

Moving away from the cylinder top, a counter-rotating vortex-pair structure is observed from which a single coherent swirling structure develops further down the cylinder.

It is unknown whether electron transfer from the radical intermediate precedes or follows its deprotonation, and answering this question would offer considerable insight into the mechanism by which the small but important class of radical-mediated alcohol dehydrogenases operate. This question can be addressed by measuring steady-state kinetic isotope effects (KIEs); however, their interpretation is obfuscated by the degree to which the steps of interest limit catalysis. To circumvent this problem, we measured the solvent deuterium KIE on the saturating steady-state concentration of the radical intermediate using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

This result implies that electron transfer from the radical intermediate does not precede deprotonation. Further analysis of these isotope effects, along with the pH dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters, likewise suggests that DesII must be in the correct protonation state for initial generation of the alpha-hydroxyalkyl radical.

Existing pipelined DLMS architectures have large adaptation delay and hence degraded convergence speed. We in this paper, first present a pipelined DLMS architecture with minimal adaptation delay for any given sampling rate. The architecture is synthesized by using a number of function preserving transformations on the signal flow graph representation of the DLMS algorithm.

The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (S. mediterranea) is an excellent system in which to study robust and nearly unlimited regeneration, guided by a population of mitotically active stem cells, termed neoblasts. Results: We characterized MMPs in the context of planarian stem cells, specifically exploring the role of S. mediterranea MT-MMPB. Using in situ hybridization and available functional genomic tools, we observed that mt-mmpB is expressed in the dorsoventral muscle cells, and its loss results in a reduction in animal size accompanied by a decrease in mitotic cells, suggesting that it plays a unique role in regulating stem cell proliferation.

Reinforced concrete is one of the most commonly used structural materials in construction industry, primarily due to its cost, durability, ability to be easily fabricated into a variety of shapes on site, and locally abundant raw material availability almost everywhere. Unlike incumbent passive reinforcing microfiber technology, in situ shrinking microfibers that respond to an in situ stimulus such as heat, pH, or moisture variations can induce precompression to matrix and create additional resistance from external loads, creating stronger composite structures. In this paper, heat-activated-shrinking (HAS) microfibers made from polyolefin, and pH-activated-shrinking (pHAS) microfibers made from chitosan powder were used to study effects of shrinking microfiber reinforcing in concrete. Shrinking ratios and tensile strengths of both microfibers were measured. Cementitious specimens with active shrinking microfibers, passive non shrinking fibers, as well as control samples were made. Mechanical properties of the samples were compared with compression and three-point bending tests. The optimum microfiber weight percentages for HAS microfibers were 0.5 wt% in compression tests, and 1.0 wt% in three-point bending tests. For pHAS microfibers, the optimum weight percentages were 0.5 wt% in three-point bending tests. Compared to heat passive microfibers specimens, 45% increase in the maximum compression strengths, and 124% increase in the maximum bending strengths were achieved at the optimum weight percentages of HAS microfibers.

Multiple pressure transmitters, taken as the measurement point, were mounted inside of the girder. A reference transmitter was mounted inside of a tower, taken as a fixed point. To verify the performance and reliability of the CPS, a controlled load test after the completion of the bridge construction and an uncontrolled load test under the actual traffic loading were carried out. The results showed that the CPS exhibited excellent capability in real-time measurement of vertical deflection of the suspension bridge. With the long-term deflection data monitored by the CPS, the extreme deflections with respect to vehicle loads were predicted by extreme value analysis. The generalized extreme value distribution was adopted to establish the probability models of the daily maximum and minimum deflection sequences, and then the extreme deflections within the design reference period of 100years were determined based on the probability models. Comparison of the extreme deflections and the deflection thresholds was carried out.

This occurs when coherent lavas are erupted subaqueously, when they flow into water, when magma intrudes into water-saturated sediments, and when magma and water interact explosively during phreatomagmatism. Quench fragmentation also occurs alongside explosive phreatomagmatic activity. AI though products of quench fragmentation (hyaloclastite sensu stricto) have been discussed qualitatively in the volcanological literature, compared to explosive fragmentation processes very little is known about the exact dynamics of quench fragmentation of magma and how this relates to the rheology and physical properties of volcanic glass. Based on literature from materials engineering, we present a detailed review of the processes by which glass forms, the properties of glass, and the fracture mechanics that cause it to fragment non explosively. We also consider how this can be applied to understanding the dynamics behind the volcanological processes of in-situ glass fragmentation during quenching in wet environments and phreatomagmatism. Important parameters for the occurrence of quench fragmentation are the temperature difference between the magma and the ambient water and how much the ambient water is superheated above its Leidenfrost temperature. The geometry of the lava or magma intrusion, the thermal conductivity and the thermal expansion are also of great importance. The resistance of the magma against fragmentation can be increased with the presence of crystals provided the thermal expansion of the crystals does not greatly exceed that of the glass; vesicles have the opposite effect, unless the magma is highly vesicular.

This paper analyzes an aircraft auxiliary power offtake to produce a reduced-order mechanical drivetrain model, allowing the modal frequencies to be predicted and cross-domain interactions to be modeled. A purpose-built electromechanical test platform is used to validate the model and demonstrate how electrical disturbances are passed through the generator to the mechanical system and affect the electrical network.

MethodCohort study of people who had visited UK primary care in the past year reporting depressive symptoms (N=558, 69% female). Positive and negative recall was assessed at three time-points, 2weeks apart, using a computerised task. Depressive symptoms were assessed at four time-points using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Analyses were conducted using multilevel models. ResultsConcurrently we found evidence that, for every increase in two positive words recalled, depressive symptoms reduced by 0.6 (95% CI -1.0 to -0.2) BDI points. This association was not affected by adjustment for confounders. There was no evidence of an association between negative recall and depressive symptoms (-0.1, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.3). Longitudinally, we found more evidence that positive recall was associated with reduced depressive symptoms than vice versa.

Due to their complex pore structures with a large portion of nano pores, the flow mechanics of gas flow in the pore space may involve nanoscale effects that could not be accounted for by classic Darcy's law. It is also very difficult to experimentally probe the transport properties of extremely low permeability rock samples. Digital rock physics (DRP) obtains a direct view of the internal structure of reservoir rock sample by digitized high resolution images to compute their properties, such as porosity and directional permeability, and hence to enable the studies of multi-scale flow mechanics in mudrocks. In this study, we present a parallel lattice Boltzmann method (PLBM) for studying nanoscale effects on a three dimensional (3D) tube flow, and then to simulate the flow process of the gas flow in real 3D pore geometry of two perpendicularly cored mudrock samples (S62H and S62V), combining with some image processing methods in DRP. The pore geometry is obtained by 3D digital image data based on ultra-high resolution X-ray computed tomography (XCT) imaging. The numerical advantages of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) make it a powerful tool to simulate gas flow in such nano pores and estimate the absolute permeability. The new parallel implementation has been successfully performed on a powerful high performance computing cluster (HPCC) and validated with the analytical solution of a 3D tube flow model, which is taken as the elementary model for the pore networks. By simulating the nanoscale effects of rarefaction, slippage and roughness on gas flow in a nano tube model, we propose some more realistic parameters for simulating the gas flow in real mudrocks to study the flow mechanics, and to calculate the apparent directional permeability. The results show: 1) the simulated porosities (7.66% for S62H and 2.58% for S62V) are close to measured porosities (5.00% for S62H and 1.76% for S62V); 2) the estimated apparent permeability of S62H is 0.032 mD, which is close to the measured permeability of 0.02 mD; 3) the apparent directional permeability of S62V is not able to be estimated because the identified pores of subsamples are not connected in any direction with the image resolution of 65 nm/voxel; 4) the permeability anisotropy of S62H is clearly observed through the velocity field visualization and calculated permeability values; 5) the characteristics of pore geometry, flow velocity distribution and transport properties can be captured using DRP and the PLBM is an effective way to simulate complex gas flow in kerogen pores and estimate the apparent directional permeability.

A segregation-integration method was established for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of construction project. A mathematical model and framework to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions from construction projects have been established.

Geomorphic units also constitute the template of physical habitats for the biota. The assessment of river hydromorphological conditions is required by the European Water Framework Directive 2000/60 (WFD) for the classification and monitoring of water bodies and is useful for establishing links between their physical and biological conditions. The spatial scale of geomorphic units, incorporating their component elements and hydraulic patches, is the most appropriate to assess these links. Given the weakness of existing methods for the characterisation and assessment of geomorphic units and physical habitats (e.g., lack of a well-defined spatiotemporal framework, terminology issues, etc.), a new system for the survey and characterisation of river geomorphic units is needed that fits within a geomorphologically meaningful framework. This paper presents a system for the survey and classification of geomorphic units (GUS, geomorphic units survey and classification system) aimed at characterising physical habitats and stream morphology. The method is embedded into a multiscale, hierarchical framework for the analysis of river hydromorphological conditions. Three scales of geomorphic units are considered (i.e., macro-units, units, sub-units), organised within two spatial domains (i.e., bankfull channel and floodplain). Different levels of characterisation can be applied, depending on the aims of the survey: broad, basic, and detailed level. At each level, different, complementary information is collected. The method is applied by combining remote sensing analysis and field survey, according to the spatial scale and the level of description required. The method is applicable to most of fluvial conditions, and has been designed to be flexible and adaptable according to the objectives (e.g., reach characterisation, assessment, monitoring) and available data (e.g., image resolution). The method supports integrated hydromorphological assessment at the reach scale (e.g., the Morphological Quality Index, MQI) and therefore contributes to better establishing links between hydromorphological conditions at the reach scale, characteristic geomorphic units, and related biological conditions.

The question of whether YKL-40 is merely a marker or a causal factor in the development of cardiovascular and liver disease is addressed, with emphasis on the Mendelian randomization design. The Mendelian randomization approach uses genetic variants associated with lifelong high plasma YKL-40 levels that are largely unconfounded and not prone to reverse causation. Thus, the approach mimics a controlled double-blind randomized trial, but it uses genetic variants rather than a drug and placebo, and like a blinded trial, it allows inference about causality. Moreover, the review also covers background on the molecular biology and functions of YKL-40, YKL-40 levels in healthy individuals and reference range, and the role of YKL-40 as a biomarker of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. YKL-40 is a plasma protein named after its three N-terminal amino acids, Y (tyrosine), K (lysine) and L (leucine), and its molecular weight of 40kDa. It is produced by local inflammatory cells in inflamed tissues, such as lipid-laden macrophages inside the vessel wall and perhaps also hepatic stellate cells. Observational studies show that plasma YKL-40 levels are elevated in patients with cardiovascular and liver disease and are associated with disease severity and prognosis. Furthermore, elevated plasma YKL-40 levels in apparently healthy individuals are associated with a 2-fold increased risk of future ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism, but not with myocardial infarction, suggesting that YKL-40 could play a role in the formation of embolisms rather than atherosclerosis per se. Further, elevated YKL-40 levels combined with excessive alcohol consumption are associated with 10-years risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis of up to 7%, suggesting that YKL-40 can be used as a strong noninvasive marker of predicting alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Importantly, in Mendelian randomization studies, genetically elevated plasma YKL-40 levels were not associated with risk of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease, thus suggesting that plasma YKL-40 does not play a causal role in the development of these diseases. Despite this, plasma YKL-40 levels may play a role in disease progression after diagnosis, and inhibition of YKL-40 activity might be a novel therapy in some cardiovascular and liver diseases.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 30294, "input": "Reinforced soil foundations (RSFs) have been employed in engineering practice to increase the soil bearing capacity and to reduce the potential footing settlement.

Using FHL2(-/-) mice, we found that FHL2 controls NK cell development in the bone marrow and maturation in peripheral organs. To evaluate the importance of FHL2 in NK cell activation, FHL2(-/-) mice were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. FHL2(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to this infection. The activation of lung NK cells is altered in FHL2(-/-) mice, leading to decreased IFN. production and a loss of control of bacterial burden.

The aim of this study was to develop and verify a mathematical model for pier scour predictions. A new approach is taken that combines shallow-water equations with non-hydrostatic pressure corrections and a non-uniform mesh in the horizontal with terrain-following layers in the vertical. This approach significantly improves computational efficiency from the conventional computational fluid dynamics approach. It is concluded that, emerging from the lateral sides of a pier (cylinder), scour deepens while the patterns migrate upstream towards the pier's upstream nose. On the upstream side, scour continues to grow until the bed slope reaches the angle of repose of sediments. On the downstream side, scour grows until equilibrium is reached. The scour hole is shallower downstream than upstream of the pier. The presence of the pier causes a strong downflow near its upstream nose, a strong vortex at its foot on the upstream side and a weak vortex on the downstream side. The predicted flow velocity and scour depth agree well with measurements. The terrain-following layer feature is particularly useful for scour computations; the high efficiency makes the model practical for field-scale applications, which are highly relevant to improved design of pier foundations and pier scour control.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 43943, "input": "Trauma survivors, and particularly torture survivors, suffer from high rates of chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for years afterward, along with alterations in the function of the pain system. On the basis of longitudinal data on PTSD symptomatology, we tested whether exposure to torture, PTSD or PTSD trajectories accounted for chronic pain and altered pain perception. Participants were 59 torture survivors and 44 age-matched healthy control subjects. Chronic pain was characterized. Pain threshold, pain tolerance, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and temporal summation of pain were measured. Three PTSD trajectories were identified among torture survivors; chronic, delayed, and resilient. Lack of CPM and more intense chronic pain was found among the chronic and delayed groups compared with the resilient and healthy control groups. Temporal summation of pain was strongest among the chronic group. PTSD trajectories mediated the relationship between torture and CPM. It appears that the duration and severity of posttraumatic distress, rather than the exposure to trauma, are crucial factors that mediate the association between trauma and chronic pain. Because PTSD and its resultant distress are measurable, their evaluation seems particularly important in the management of pain among trauma survivors. The results may be generalized to other instances in which chronic pain persists after traumatic events. Perspective: This article presents the mediation effect of PTSD trajectory on pain modulation among trauma survivors suggesting that it is the duration and severity of PTSD/distress, rather than the exposure to trauma per se, that influence the perception and modulation of pain.

In Phase II, a random subsample of these students (n = 104) participated in the eating disorder examination, a structured interview that yields ED diagnoses. Analyses were conducted to evaluate the SCOFF's criterion validity by examining (a) correlations between scores on the SCOFF and the EDI-2 and (b) the SCOFF ' s ability to differentiate diagnosed ED cases and non-cases. Results: EDI-2 subscales showed high correlations with the SCOFF scores proving initial evidence of criterion validity. A score of two points on the SCOFF optimized the sensitivity (78 %) and specificity (84 %). With this cutoff, the SCOFF correctly classified over half the cases (PPV = 58 %) and screened out the majority of non-cases (NPV = 93 %) providing further evidence of criterion validity.

We studied the northern common eider duck (Somateria mollissima) to explore how Hg in association with both natural levels and experimentally reduced parasitic infections, affect reproduction and survival. Female eiders were measured, banded, and blood sampled to determine blood Hg burdens, prior to breeding. Propensity to nest, clutch size, nest survival, nest attendance, and return rates were assessed in relation to both Hg burden and parasite treatment. Neither reproduction nor return rates of females varied with Hg concentrations, but females arriving late to the colony, or in low body condition, showed increased nesting propensity when given the anti-parasite treatment as compared to placebo treatment.

As we considered that the poor codon usage bias may be one limiting factor leading to the inefficient translation and scFv production, we designed and synthesized the full-length scFv gene by choosing the P. pastoris preferred codons while keeping the G + C content at relatively low level. Codon optimization increased the scFv expression level 3- to 5-fold and up to 6-10 mg/L. Northern blotting further confirmed that the increase of scFv expression was mainly due to the enhancement of translation efficiency. Investigation of culture conditions revealed that the maximal cell growth and scFv expression were achieved at pH 6.5-7.0 with 2% casamino acids after 72 h methanol induction.

Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with a vast cognitive and clinical phenotype. To date, several resting-state fMRI studies reported altered functional connectivity in 22q11.2DS, however BOLD signal variance has not yet been analyzed. Here, we employed PLS correlation analysis to reveal multivariate patterns of diagnosis-related alterations and age-relationship throughout the cortex of 50 patients between 9 and 25 years old and 50 healthy controls in the same age range. To address how functional connectivity in the default mode network is influenced by BOLD signal fluctuations, we conducted the same analysis on seed-to-voxel connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and compared resulting brain patterns. BOLD signal variance was lower mainly in regions of the default mode network and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but higher in large parts of the temporal lobes. In those regions, BOLD signal variance was correlated with age in healthy controls, but not in patients, suggesting deviant developmental trajectories from child- to adulthood. Positive connectivity of the PCC within the default mode network as well as negative connectivity towards the frontoparietal network were weaker in patients with 22q11.2DS.

The implementation is entirely based on open source libraries. The spatial discretization is solved using a streamline upwind Petrov Galerkin stabilization of an iso-parametric, collocation based, boundary element method, implemented using the open source library deal.11. The resulting nonlinear differential-algebraic system is integrated in time using implicit backward differentiation formulas, implemented in the open source library SUNDIALS. The Open CASCADE library is used to interface the model directly with computer-aided design data structures. The model accounts automatically for hulls with a transom stern, both in wet and dry regimes, by using a specific treatment of the free-surface nodes on the stern edge that automatically detects when the hull advances at low speeds. In this case, the transom stern is partially immersed, and a pressure patch is applied on the water surface detaching from the transom stern, to recover the gravity effect of the recirculating water on the underlying irrotational flow domain. The parameters of the model used to impose the pressure patch are approximated from experimental relations found in the literature.

Assuming an elastic-perfectly plastic model, a smeared shear band approach and a modified initial stress method enable the proposed procedure to create an explicit collapse mode by the stress yield condition.

A stress-level buffeting analysis requires knowledge of characteristics of distributed aerodynamic forces on the surfaces of a bridge deck. This paper first presents a formulation for distributed aerodynamic forces on the surfaces of a bridge deck based on the quasi-steady theory. The characteristics of distributed aerodynamic forces, such as pressure coefficients, pressure admittances and span-wise pressure coherences, are introduced in the formulation. In consideration of different characteristics of incident and signature turbulences, the empirical mode decomposition is then adopted to separate their effects on the distributed aerodynamic forces. Wind tunnel pressure tests of a sectional motionless bridge deck model were conducted to identify the characteristics of distributed aerodynamic forces on the surfaces of the Stonecutters cable-stayed bridge with a twin-box bridge deck as a case study. The results indicate that the separation of incident and signature turbulence effects is necessary and that the proposed framework is feasible although more works need to be done towards a complete stress-level buffeting analysis.

Moreover, the influence of increasing concentration ratios on the thermal and thermodynamic optimum conditions was considered for concentration ratios between 88 and 113. To obtain the system's precise thermal and thermodynamic performance, a well-validated numerical model, with a typical heat flux profile on the outer wall of the receiver's absorber tube, was developed using a finite volume based computational fluid dynamics tool together with Monte Carlo ray tracing. Results show that silver-Therminol (R) VP-1 nanofluid gives the highest thermal performance owing to its comparatively better thermal transport properties, whereas Al2O3-Therminol (R) VP-1 showed the lowest thermal performance. Given the increase in the useful energy gain from the collector with heat transfer enhancement, the thermal efficiency was shown to increase by 13.9%, 12.5% and 7.2% for silver-Therminol (R) VP-1, copper-Therminol (R) VP-1 and Al2O3-Therminol (R) VP-1, respectively when the concentration ratio is 113. With increasing concentration ratios, the increase in thermal efficiency at a concentration ratio of 113 was shown to be about 5% higher than the increase at a concentration ratio of 88. The optimal thermal performance was nearly at the same flow rate of about 22.5 m(3) h(-1) for all the nanofluids and concentration ratios. The optimal thermodynamic performance for low exergy destruction was mainly dependent on the inlet temperature used.

However, the relationship between dentate gyrus volume and peripheral oxidative stress markers remains unknown. Here, we examined dentate gyrus-cornu ammonis (CA) 4 volume longitudinally in patients with bipolar II disorder (BD-II) and healthy controls and investigated whether BD-II is associated with elevated peripheral levels of oxidative stress. Methods: We acquired high-resolution structural 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and quantified hippocampal subfield volumes using an automated segmentation algorithm in individuals with BD-II (n=29) and controls (n=33). The participants were scanned twice, at study inclusion and on average 2.4 years later. In addition, we measured peripheral levels of two lipid peroxidation markers (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal [4-HNE] and lipid hydroperoxides [LPH]). Results: First, we demonstrated that the automated hippocampal subfield segmentation technique employed in this work reliably measured dentate gyrus-CA4 volume. Second, we found a decreased left dentate gyrus-CA4 volume in patients and that a larger number of depressive episodes between T1 and T2 predicted greater volume decline. Finally, we showed that 4-HNE was elevated in BD-II and that 4-HNE was negatively associated with left and right dentate gyrus-CA4 volumes in patients. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a role for the dentate gyrus in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and suggest that depressive episodes and elevated oxidative stress might contribute to hippocampal volume decreases.

Other facets of hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming in disease pathogenesis require further investigation. In this study, we examined the connection between hypoxia-augmented glutamine catabolism in osteoblasts and the development of periapical lesions. Methods: Primary human osteoblasts were cultured under hypoxia. The expression of glutaminase 1 (GLS1) was examined using Western blot analysis. The production of glutamate was measured by colorimetric assay. Knockdown of GLS1 was performed with small interfering RNA technology. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secretion and chemotaxis of J774 macrophages were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and transwell migration assay, respectively. In a rat model of induced periapical lesions, the relations between disease progression and osteoblastic expression of GLS1 or macrophage recruitment were studied. Results: Hypoxia enhanced GLS1 expression and subsequent glutamate production in osteoblasts. Glutamate induced chemoattraction of macrophages by osteoblasts through up regulation of CCL2 synthesis. Hypoxia promoted CCL2 secretion and macrophage recruitment through augmentation of glutaminolysis. Knockdown of GLS1 abolished hypoxia-induced effects. In rat periapical lesions, progressive bone resorption was significantly related to elevated GLS1 expression in osteoblasts and increased macrophage recruitment. Conclusions: In addition to the rise in glycolytic activity, the progression of periapical lesions is also associated with enhanced glutamine catabolism in osteoblasts.

Data were gathered in four rice producing communities in 2014 using household surveys (n = 83 households), focus group discussions, surveying of land elevations along the Amazon River, and interpretation of remote sensing imagery. The probability, extent, and severity of rice crop shortfalls were estimated for recent production years and the economic losses to farming households were also assessed. Our findings point to a very high risk of crop shortfalls due to natural hazards, suggesting that a good year brings rice farmers bounty and a bad year, near penury. River stage reversals (repiquetes) and edaphic conditions were found to be more problematic than the often cited hazard of high and/or early floods. Also surprisingly, farmers' perceptions of hazards and risk diverged markedly from actual shortfalls experienced during the production years studied.

This paper presents a comparative study of different plasmasphere and topside ionosphere data aiming at establishing an appropriate database for plasmasphere modelling. We analyze electron density profiles along the geomagnetic field lines derived from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite/Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) records of remote plasma sounding with radio waves. We compare these RPI profiles with 2D reconstructions of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere electron density derived from GNSS based TEC measurements onboard the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite. Most of the coincidences between IMAGE profiles and CHAMP reconstructions are detected in the region with L-shell between 2 and 5. In general the CHAMP reconstructed electron densities are below the IMAGE profile densities, with median of the CHAMP minus IMAGE residuals around -588 cm(-3). Additionally, a comparison is made with electron densities derived from passive radio wave RPI measurements onboard the IMAGE satellite. Over the available 2001-2005 period of IMAGE measurements, the considered combined data from the active and passive RPI operations cover the region within a latitude range of +/- 60 degrees N, all longitudes, and an L-shell ranging from 1.2 to 15. In the coincidence regions (mainly 2 <= L <= 4), we check the agreement between available active and passive RPI data. The comparison shows that the measurements are well correlated, with a median residual of similar to 52 cm(-3). The RMS and STD values of the relative residuals are around 22% and 21% respectively.

Methods: Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and obesity (OB) were investigated in reference to normal weight controls (HC). AN were additionally investigated longitudinally. Gastric emptying, antral contractions and oro-cecal transit after ingestion of a solid meal were investigated by MRI and C-13-lactose-ureide breath test. The dependency of self-reported sensations of satiation on the varying degree of stomach filling during gastric emptying was compared between groups. Results: 24 AN (BMI 14.4 (11.9-16.0) kg/m(2)), 16 OB (34.9 (29.6-41.5) kg/m(2)) and 20 HC (21.9 (18.9-24.9) kg/m(2)) were studied. Gastric half-emptying time (t(50)) was slower in AN than HC (p = 0.016) and OB (p = 0.007), and a negative association between t(50) and BMI was observed between BMI 12 and 25 kg/m(2) (p = 0.007).

We refer to so endowed entities as luminous robots. We study the computational power of luminous robots with respect to the three main settings of activation and synchronization: fully-synchronous, semi-synchronous, and asynchronous. We establish several results. A main contribution is the constructive proof that asynchronous robots, illuminated with a constant number of colors, are strictly more powerful than traditional semi-synchronous robots. We also constructively prove that, for luminous robots, the difference between asynchrony and semi-synchrony disappears. This result must be contrasted with the strict dominance between the models without lights (even if the robots are enhanced with an unbounded amount of persistent internal memory). Additionally we show that there are problems that robots cannot solve without lights, even if they are fully-synchronous, but can be solved by asynchronous luminous robots with O(1) colors. It is still open whether or not asynchronous luminous robots with O(1) colors are more powerful than fully-synchronous robots without lights. We prove that this is indeed the case if the robots have the additional capability of remembering a single snapshot.

Therefore, optimization of the construction schedule is essential for construction management to save a large amount of time and investment costs. Construction simulation is an important tool for the construction schedule optimization of high arch dams. Most current studies involving construction schedule simulations do not concurrently consider real-time construction situations and site managers' requirements. In this paper, the real-time interactive simulation is proposed that could solve this problem. The real-time construction process is the initial condition of the simulation, and the actual construction parameters are the basis of the simulation parameters. Additionally, site managers can change the simulation strategy dynamically or enter requirements based on real-time construction situations. For a simulation result, different schemes are optimized with the entropy weight method. With this method, the construction simulation can track the rapid changes in construction situations and provide a reasonable construction schedule, which increases the flexibility of the construction simulation. The optimized construction scheme could be an effective guide for site construction. With a 4D (three dimensional model and time) CAD model, the simulation process can be well expressed. A case study shows that the construction schedule can be established in real time, and it's a useful tool for decision-making.", "class": "Civil Engineering"}, {"id": 7214, "input": "Background: Meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is a common occurrence among women in spontaneous labor at term, and has been associated with adverse outcomes in both mother and neonate. MSAF is a risk factor for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) and preterm birth among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. We now report the frequency of MIAC and the presence of bacterial endotoxin in the amniotic fluid of patients with MSAF at term. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including women in presumed preterm labor because of uncertain dates who underwent amniocentesis, and were later determined to be at term (n = 108). Patients were allocated into two groups: (1) MSAF (n = 66) and (2) clear amniotic fluid (n = 42). The presence of bacteria was determined by microbiologic techniques, and endotoxin was detected using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) gel clot assay. Statistical analyses were performed to test for normality and bivariate comparisons. Results: Bacteria were more frequently present in patients with MSAF compared to those with clear amniotic fluid [19.6% (13/66) versus 4.7% (2/42); p<0.05]. The microorganisms were Gram-negative rods (n = 7), Ureaplasma urealyticum (n = 4), Gram-positive rods (n = 2) and Mycoplasma hominis (n = 1). The LAL gel clot assay was positive in 46.9% (31/66) of patients with MSAF, and in 4.7% (2/42) of those with clear amniotic fluid (p < 0.001). After heat treatment, the frequency of a positive LAL gel clot assay remained higher in the MSAF group [18.1% (12/66) versus 2.3% (1/42), p<0.05]. Median amniotic fluid IL-6 concentration (ng/mL) was higher [1.3 (0.7-1.9) versus 0.6 (0.3-1.2), p=0.04], and median amniotic fluid glucose concentration (mg/dL) was lower [6 (0-8.9) versus 9 (7.4-12.6), p<0.001] in the MSAF group, than in those with clear amniotic fluid.

We present a class of sparse matrices A, and a corresponding algorithm that we call short and fast(1) (SHO-FA) that, with high probability over A, can reconstruct x from Ax. The SHO-FA algorithm is related to the invertible bloom lookup tables recently introduced by Goodrich et al., with two important distinctions-SHO-FA relies on linear measurements, and is robust to noise. The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to simultaneously have the following properties: 1) it requires only O(k) measurements; 2) the bit precision of each measurement and each arithmetic operation is O(log(n) + P) (here, 2(-P) corresponds to the desired relative error in the reconstruction of x); 3) the computational complexity of decoding is O(k) arithmetic operations and that of encoding is O(n) arithmetic operations; and 4) if the reconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all of x, with significant probability over A, this can be done in constant time. All the above constants are independent of all problem parameters other than the desired probability of success. For a wide range of parameters, these properties are information-theoretically order-optimal. In addition, our SHO-FA algorithm works over fairly general ensembles of sparse random matrices, and is robust to random noise and (random) approximate sparsity for a large range of k. In particular, suppose the measured vector equals A(x + z) + e, where z and e correspond to the source tail and measurement noise, respectively. Under reasonable statistical assumptions on z and e, our decoding algorithm reconstructs x with an estimation error of O(parallel to z parallel to(2) + parallel to e parallel to(2)). The SHO-FA algorithm works with high probability over A, z, and e, and still requires only O(k) steps and O(k) measurements over O(log(n))-bit numbers. This is in contrast to most existing algorithms that focus on the worst case z model, where it is known that Omega(k log(n/k)) measurements over O(log(n))-bit numbers are necessary.

The best results for rhamnolipids (9.1 g/L, emulsification index of 84%, surface tension of 35 mN/m) and ethanol (8.4 g/L) were obtained after 86 h of fermentation of ESB (250 g/L, 30 degrees C), using CEC from SSF of ESB (20% wt/wt), RB (30% wt/wt) and water (50% wt/wt). It was also observed that the fermented bagasse had approximately the same calorific value of a bagasse in nature and could be used as a potential source of energy.

The blood kinetics were determined following iv administration to rats of PGME and PGMEA of low [10 and 14.7 mg/kg body weight (bw)] or high (100 and 147 mg/kg) equimolar dosages of PGME and PGMEA, respectively. The blood time courses of PGME elimination for both dosages of both compounds were identical.

This study examines the role of shame, depressive symptoms, weight and shape concerns and eating concerns, and body image-related cognitive fusion, on binge eating symptomatology severity. Participated in this study 73 patients with the diagnosis of BED, established through a clinical interviewEating Disorder Examination 17.0Dwho completed measures of external shame, body-image related cognitive fusion, depressive symptoms and binge eating symptomatology. Results revealed positive associations between binge eating severity and depressive symptoms, shame, weight and shape concerns, eating concerns and body image-related cognitive fusion. A path analysis showed that, when controlling for the effect of depressive symptoms, external shame has a direct effect on binge eating severity, and an indirect effect mediated by increased eating concern and higher levels of body image-related cognitive fusion. Results confirmed the plausibility of the model, which explained 43% of the severity of binge eating symptoms. The proposed model suggests that, in BED patients, perceiving that others see the self negatively may be associated with an entanglement with body image-related thoughts and concerns about eating, which may, in turn, fuel binge eating symptoms.

However, investigations of nonverbal behavior in the evaluation of depressed patients are still scarce. This study examines the nonverbal behaviors of a group of Brazilian patients, associating their nonverbal behavior with severity of depression. Methods: Forty depressed patients were evaluated at baseline (TO) and after a two-week transcranial direct current stimulation treatment (T1), according to rating scales and through a 21-category Ethogram for assessment of the frequency of nonverbal behaviors displayed during an interview. Results: Behaviors that were related to negative feelings and social disinterest decreased with corresponding clinical improvement and were associated with increased severity of symptoms at TO and greater negative affect and dissatisfaction at T1. Pro-social behaviors were associated with milder symptoms at TO and increased after treatment Facial, head and hand expressive movements stood out as important indicators because of their associations with severity of depression. Limitations: Duration of behaviors was not assessed and there was not a healthy control group with which to compare the findings.

In the present review, some views are given on how well the initial expectations on the use of the microdialysis technique in skeletal muscle have been fulfilled, and the areas in which additional work is needed in order to validate microdialysis as an important metabolic technique in this tissue. The microdialysis catheter has been equated to an artificial blood vessel, which is introduced into the tissue. By means of this 'vessel' the concentrations of compounds in the interstitial space can be monitored. The concentration of substances in the collected samples is dependent on the rate of perfusate flow. When perfusate flow is slow enough to allow complete equilibration between interstitial and perfusate fluids, the concentration in the perfusate is maximal and identical to the interstitial concentration. Microdialysis data may be influenced by changes in blood flow, especially in instances where the tissue diffusivity limits the recovery in vivo, i.e, when recovery in vitro is 100 %, whereas the recovery in vivo is less than 100 %. Microdialysis data indicate that a significant arterial-interstitial glucose concentration gradient exists in skeletal muscle but not in adipose tissue at rest. While the concentrations of glucose and lactate in the dialysate from skeletal muscle are close to the expected values, the glycerol values obtained for muscle are still puzzling.

Here, a novel experimental numerical methodology is introduced to strengthen the integrated understanding of the microstructure and mechanical properties of these alloys, enabling joint analyses of deformation-induced evolution of the microstructure, and the strain and stress distribution therein, down to submicron resolution. From the experiments, deformation-induced evolution of (i) the microstructure, and (ii) the local strain distribution are concurrently captured, employing in situ secondary electron imaging and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) (for the former), and microscopic-digital image correlation (for the latter). From the simulations, local strain as well as stress distributions are revealed, through 2-D full-field crystal plasticity (CP) simulations conducted with an advanced spectral solver suitable for heterogeneous materials.

It is unclear, however, what cognitive process drives these effects: a simulation process in which the own mental states are used as a proxy for those of others (self-projection) or an effortful other-enhancement process in which one's own perspective is overridden. In this fMRI study we examined the effects of mentalizing with similar and dissimilar others on behavioral and brain measures of empathy and prosocial behavior, to assess which cognitive process mediates the facilitative effects of mentalizing. Participants had to mentalize with two fictitious target persons, one of whom was manipulated to have similar thoughts and beliefs as the participant, while the other had dissimilar mental states. We then assessed participants' behavioral and neural responses during an empathy for pain task and a prosocial behavior task. Similarity between participant and target person increased empathy and affiliation ratings, and mentalizing with dissimilar persons evoked increased activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the extent of which was inversely related with bias towards the similar person in empathy. Responses in two dmPFC regions were also predictive of later variations in subsequent empathy and prosocial behavior, either predicting overall prosociality and empathic concern (lateral dmPFC), or predicting reduced empathic bias towards the similar person and a lower response to self-related stressors in pain matrix areas (medial dmPFC). This pattern of results suggests that generating and enhancing other-related representations while overcoming one's own perspective, rather than enhanced recruitment of self-projection processes, is driving the facilitative effects of mentalizing on later empathic and prosocial responses.

Results indicate that narrowband indices utilize reflectance data from one or more wavelengths in the red-edge region (similar to 690-750 nm) perform better. Broadband indices are found to be as effective as narrowband indices for chlorophyll content estimation at both leaf and canopy scales. The empirical relationships are generally stronger at the canopy than the leaf scale, attributable to the fact that leaf samples are collected during the peak growing season when chlorophyll in plant species are uniform. SPOT-5 and CASI-550 derived chlorophyll maps result in map accuracies of 63.56% and 78.88% respectively.

Design and methods: We used a cross-sectional survey design, and collected data electronically from 738 male intercollegiate athletes in the U.S. Results: Athletes who self-weighed 7 + times per week reported the most pressure to lose weight and be lean and muscular, engaged in muscle-building behaviors most frequently, dieted most often, and had the highest level of bulimic symptomatology. Further, athletes on teams that conducted mandatory weigh-ins (vs. not) engaged in more muscularity behaviors and dietary restriction.

In traditional off-highway working vehicles, the working hydraulics is supplied through pipes, hoses, and valves by a hydraulic pump located near the main engine. A significant amount of energy is lost in long pipelines and hoses as well as in valve throttles. A new topology is introduced to supply the power along the long boom; the power for a hydraulic actuator is supplied by an integrated electro-hydraulic energy converter (IEHEC), which is located at the boom end. The electrical energy to the converter is supplied through electrical cables, which have negligible losses compared with a conventional fluid power supply with long pipelines. The converter transforms the electrical energy into hydraulic energy at the end of the boom, and may also recover energy for additional energy savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sialic acids are part of a larger family of nonulosonic acid (NulO) molecules that includes pseudaminic and legionaminic acids. Microbial expression of sialic acids and other nonulosonic acids has been shown to contribute to host-microbe interactions in a variety of contexts, including participation in colonization, immune subversion, and behaviors such as biofilm formation, autoagglutination and motility. Previous research has suggested that some spirochetes may also express these molecules. Results: Here we use a combination of molecular tools to investigate the presence of NulO biosynthetic gene clusters among clinical and saprophytic isolates of the genus Leptospira. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting suggested that a variety of leptospires encoded NulO biosynthetic pathways. High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses provided biochemical evidence that di-N-acetylated NulO molecules are expressed at relatively high levels by L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 55601, and at lower levels by L. alexanderi serovar Manhao and L. fainei serovar Hurstbridge. Endogenous expression of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, the most common sialic acid) was documented in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130. Neu5Ac biosynthesis is also supported by a unique gene fusion event resulting in an enzyme with an N-terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase domain and a C-terminal phosphatase domain. This gene fusion suggests that L. interrogans uses a Neu5Ac biosynthetic pathway more similar to animals than to other bacteria. Analysis of the composition and phylogeny of putative NulO biosynthetic gene clusters in L. interrogans serovar Lai and serovar Copenhageni revealed that both strains have complete biosynthetic pathways for legionamimic acid synthesis, a molecule with the same stereochemistry as sialic acid. Lectin-based affinity purification of NulO-modified molecules, followed by mass spectrometric identification suggests post-translational modification of surface lipoproteins, including Loa22.

Here, we classify a basic array of strategies for water management; discuss morphological features and active means; and list corresponding examples from nature, to facilitate the search for and the selection of strategies from the large database of nature, and inspire new design solutions.

A distinguishing feature of these enzymes is a [4Fe-4S] cluster to which each of three iron ions is ligated by three cysteinyl residues most often located in a Cx(3)Cx(2)C motif. The alpha-amino and alpha-carboxylate groups of SAM anchor the molecule to the remaining iron ion, which presumably facilitates its reductive cleavage. A subset of RS enzymes contains additional iron-sulfur clusters, -which we term auxiliary clusters - most of which have unidentified functions. Enzymes in this subset are involved in cofactor biosynthesis and maturation, post-transcriptional and post-translational modification, enzyme activation, and antibiotic biosynthesis. The additional clusters in these enzymes have been proposed to function in sulfur donation, electron transfer, and substrate anchoring. This review will highlight evidence supporting the presence of multiple iron-sulfur clusters in these enzymes as well as their predicted roles in catalysis.

The synthesised intercalation compound, zinc layered hydroxide-L-phenylalanate (ZLH-LP), was characterised using PXRD, FTIR, CHNS, ICP-OES, TGA/DTG, FESEM and TEM. The PXRD patterns of the intercalation compound demonstrate an intense and symmetrical peak, indicating a well-ordered crystalline layered structure. The appearance of an intercalation peak at a low angle of 20 with a basal spacing of 16.3 A, signifies the successful intercalation of the L-phenylalanate anion into the interlayer gallery of the host. The intercalation is also validated by FTIR spectroscopy and CHNS elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms that the ZLH-LP intercalation compound has higher thermal stability than the pristine L-phenylalanine. The observed percentage of L-phenylalanate accumulated release varies in each release media, with 84.5%, 79.8%, 63.8% and 61.8% release in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution at pH 4.8, deionised water, PBS solution at pH 7.4 and NaCI solution, respectively. The release behaviour of LP from its intercalation compounds in deionised water and PBS solution at pH 4.8 follows pseudo second order, whereas in NaCl solution and PBS solution at pH 7.4, it follows the parabolic diffusion model.

Here, an effective selection of the importance density plays a pivotal role in performances of PFs by not only preventing degeneracy problems at early stages of process, but also taking both the transition prior and likelihood into account when the likelihood appears in the tail of the prior. To this end, we propose a novel importance density selection scheme for PF based on the minimum relative entropy principle. Theoretical derivation of the proposed scheme is presented, and its effectiveness is evaluated against various sampling schemes that exist in the literature using synthetic experiments. Finally, the performance of the proposed minimum relative entropy-based density selection scheme is successfully demonstrated for short-term electricity demand forecasting of a company located in Miami, FL, USA. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the necessity of reducing utility costs in terms of energy consumption in large-scale enterprises. Determination of the lowest cost method of providing the required amount of electricity heavily relies on accurate load demand forecast. In addition, demand forecasting problems also exist in various fields, including supply chain management, manufacturing, and microgrid networks. This paper provides an eminent approach to estimate the posterior state (i.e., demand in forthcoming periods) given the prior states (i.e., past demand) and measurements. In this paper, we mathematically derive the method using the minimum relative entropy principle. To validate the proposed method, a series of synthetic experiments are designed, and a case study of short-term electricity demand forecasting is carried out.

The presence of syncytin-1, is not sufficient to explain the complete event and ADAM12 is a major co-player candidate. Via differential splicing, the ADAM12 gene produces a short and a long form, being the ADAM12-S and the ADAM12-L respectively. Methods and results: We investigated the localisation of both variants in the human placenta using whole mount in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry and Northern blotting in 1st (n = 8) and 3rd (n = 8) trimester placentae and in the case of NB in several cell lines. In Northern blotting, 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for the ADAM12-S and Bewo, 293HEK, JAR, leucocytes, macrophages, 1st and 3rd trimester placentae were positive for ADAM12-L. In whole mount in situ hybridisation, the 1st and 3rd trimester placental syncytium was positive for both variants. In immunohistochemistry, ADAM12-L localised in the cytotrophoblast of both 1st and 3rd trimester placentae, while ADAM12-S localised in the complete syncytium, often including the cytotrophoblast. Conclusion: The different localisation of ADAM12-S and ADAM12-L indicates a possible different role making ADAM12-L a candidate for the fusion event, while the syncytial localisation of the ADAM12-S makes it a candidate for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions between the placental syncytium and the maternal interface.

Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) is an important regulator of inflammatory responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression, and miRNA-34a (miR-34a) was showed to activate vascular endothelial inflammation. We hypothesized that miR-34a may be a key regulator of placental dysfunction after fetal cardiac bypass. Methods: We evaluated miRNA expression in goat placentas via small RNA sequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Expression of miRNA target genes was determined via bioinformatics analyses and dual luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with miR-34a or a control sequence. The RCAN1, nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATCI) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) levels in HUVECs and placentas were evaluated via Western blot and qRT-PCR. Results: We demonstrated that miR-34a was highly enriched in goat placenta after cardiopulmonary bypass. Moreover, RCAN1 was identified as a novel direct target of miR-34a. Transfection of miR-34a led to decreased RCAN1 expression and increased NFATCI and NF-kappa B expression in HUVECs. Conversely, inhibition of miR-34a rescued RCAN1 expression and reduced NFATCI and NF-kappa B expression in HUVECs. Conclusions: We demonstrated a remarkable role of miR-34a as a regulator of NFATC1-associated placental inflammation through direct targeting of RCAN1. MiR-34a could serve as a novel therapeutic target for limiting the progression of placental inflammation after fetal cardiac bypass. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The reaction with H2O2 is not common to all cysteine residues, being their reactivity an utmost prerequisite for the sensitivity towards H2O2. Indeed, only deprotonated Cys (i.e. thiolate form, S-) can react with H2O2 leading to sulphenic acid formation (SOH), which is considered as a major/central player of ROS sensing pathways. However, cysteine sulphenic acids are generally unstable because they can be further oxidized to irreversible forms (sulphinic and sulphonic acids, SO2H and SO3H, respectively), or alternatively, they can proceed towards further modifications including disulphide bond formation (SS), S-glutathionylation (SSG) and sulphenamide formation (SN). To understand why and how cysteine residues undergo primary oxidation to sulphenic acid, and to explore the stability of cysteine sulphenic acids, a combination of biochemical, structural and computational studies are required. Here, we will discuss the current knowledge of the structural determinants for cysteine reactivity and sulphenic acid stability within protein microenvironments. This review highlights the importance of acidity and nucleophilicity of protein cysteine thiols in determining the rate of H2O2-mediated primary oxidation to sulphenic acids. The stability and reactivity of sulphenic acids is also investigated, being strictly correlated to the cysteine microenvironment and dependent upon structural determinants, which are specific of each protein sensitive to oxidation. These findings reinforce the prominent role of cysteine sulphenic acids in redox signalling, but a combination of biochemical, structural and computational approaches is mandatory to get insight into the kinetic and thermodynamics factors controlling cysteine oxidation.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 1431, "input": "A study has been carried out in three French hospitals in order to assess and model the pharmaceutical load in hospital wastewater and its impact in WWTP.

In the last step, the comparison of measured and calculated concentrations showed a satisfactory correlation for some pharmaceuticals, mainly those with short elimination half-lifes and weak human metabolism.

This article aims to analyze the vulnerability of drinking water management during and after a natural disaster in the rural and coastal areas of Bangladesh. We have considered the extreme event of cyclone 'Aila', which devastated the coastal district of Satkhira in 2009. In the study area, the collection of drinking water in normal situations is difficult mainly because of the spatially varied availability of drinking water sources (tube wells, ponds and rainwater harvesting units). In addition, the decreasing trend in pre-monsoon rainfall intensity as well as the increased salinity play a significant role in this regard. Due to the destruction of the coastal embankment during cyclone 'Aila', saltwater intruded into the locality and heavily damaged the drinking water sources. To analyze the associated vulnerability factors in the drinking water sector, we conducted a household-based structured questionnaire survey in three 'mouza' (revenue collection unit) of the Satkhira district. Using principal component analysis, we have identified six factors influencing drinking water vulnerability. The factors are related to warning dissemination, damage to water sources, damage to household's water reserves, collection time, family composition, and frequency of water collection. We have used the factors to prepare an index for the comparative analysis of vulnerability among the three 'mouza'. Considering the vulnerability issues, the article concludes by presenting the scope for a robust drinking water management plan for the coastal areas of Bangladesh. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The PAA nanofiber was reacted with hyperbranched polyethylenimine (HPEI) and further with glycidol to introduce the vicinal hydroxyl groups. The chemical composition and surface characteristics of the obtained PAA-g-PG membranes were evaluated by FESEM, FTIR, XPS and water contact angles (WCA) measurements.

The results showed that the PAA nanofiber spun from concentration of 15% had uniform morphology and narrow diameter distribution. The PAA-g-PG nanofiber membrane had a maximum boron uptake of 5.68 mmol/g and could adsorb 0.82 mmol/g boron from a 5 mg/L solution in 15 min. Both the high surface area of nanofibers and the hyperbranched structure should contribute to the high boron uptake and high adsorption rate. The nanofiber membrane obeyed the Langmuir adsorption model and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model.

Several specifications of multivariate time-varying weights are introduced with a particular focus on weight dynamics driven by the past performance of the predictive densities and the use of learning mechanisms. In the proposed approach the model set can be incomplete, meaning that all models can be individually misspecified. A Sequential Monte Carlo method is proposed to approximate the filtering and predictive densities. The combination approach is assessed using statistical and utility-based performance measures for evaluating density forecasts of simulated data, US macroeconomic time series and surveys of stock market prices. Simulation results indicate that, for a set of linear autoregressive models, the combination strategy is successful in selecting, with probability close to one, the true model when the model set is complete and it is able to detect parameter instability when the model set includes the true model that has generated subsamples of data. Also, substantial uncertainty appears in the weights when predictors are similar; residual uncertainty reduces when the model set is complete; and learning reduces this uncertainty. For the macro series we find that incompleteness of the models is relatively large in the 1970's, the beginning of the 1980's and during the recent financial crisis, and lower during the Great Moderation; the predicted probabilities of recession accurately compare with the NBER business cycle dating; model weights have substantial uncertainty attached. With respect to returns of the S&P 500 series, we find that an investment strategy using a combination of predictions from professional forecasters and from a white noise model puts more weight on the white noise model in the beginning of the 1990's and switches to giving more weight to the professional forecasts over time. Information on the complete predictive distribution and not just on some moments turns out to be very important, above all during turbulent times such as the recent financial crisis.

This paper focuses on the engineering value stream. The methods of lean manufacturing can be applied for waste elimination in engineering. The dissemination of lean manufacturing principles into engineering would multiply the significant benefits already derived by embracing lean in the manufacturing part of the enterprise.

Such a systematic method will help engineering organizations systematically identify, measure, and eliminate engineering wastes from all engineering processes. The systematic method is then used to demonstrate the elimination of waste in engineering through its application to the manufacturing equipment installation - a manufacturing engineering process.

Different trap depths are generated forming a successive defect structure in this three-dimensional framework of SrGa2O4 containing channels occupied by Sr2+ when Tb3+ ions are introduced. The captured carriers in shallow traps are spontaneously released at room temperature and recombine in the luminescence center of Tb3+, eventually causing characteristic emission of Tb3+. The deeper traps are critically important to prevent the thermal fading of carriers at room temperature, therefore, LPL is achieved in SrGa2O4:Tb3+ phosphor at 328 K. Furthermore, a photo-stimulated luminescence (PSL) originated from Tb3+ ions is realized in SrGa2O4:Tb3+ phosphor induced by 980 nm laser diode with the releasing of the carriers trapped in the deeper traps at room temperature.

The contour (zero level set) in existing methods passes through triangles of the mesh.

The change of PS/TS ratio in influent also altered the cycle behaviors of activated sludge. With the increase of PS/TS ratio from 0 to 0.5 and 1, the ammonium and nitrite utilization rate increased 2 and 3 times, respectively. The q-PCR results showed that the abundance of nitrifiers in activated sludge for PS/TS ratio of 0.5 and 1 were 0.7-0.8 and 1.4-1.5 orders of magnitude higher than that for PS/TS ratio of 0. However, the abundance of total bacteria decreased about 0.5 orders of magnitude from the former two to the latter. The FISH observation confirmed that the nitrifiers' microcolony became bigger and more robust with the increase of PS/TS ratio. This paper paves a path to understand the role of PS/TS in affecting the nitrification process in biological wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Murine CrAT is encoded by a single gene located in the opposite orientation head to head to the PPP2R4 gene, sharing a very condensed bi-directional promoter. Since decreased CrAT expression is correlated with metabolic inflexibility and subsequent pathological consequences, our aim was to reveal and define possible activators of CrAT transcription in the normal embryonic murine liver cell line BNL CL. 2 and via which nuclear factors based on key metabolites mainly regulate hepatic expression of CrAT. Here we describe a functional characterization of the CrAT promoter region under conditions of L-carnitine deficiency and supplementation as well as fenofibrate induction in cell culture cells. Results: The murine CrAT promoter displays some characteristics of a housekeeping gene: it lacks a TATA-box, is very GC-rich and harbors two Sp1 binding sites. Analysis of the promoter activity of CrAT by luciferase assays uncovered a L-carnitine sensitive region within -342 bp of the transcription start. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays proved the sequence element (-228/-222) to be an L-carnitine sensitive RXR alpha binding site, which also showed sensitivity to application of anti-PPAR alpha and anti-PPARbp antibodies. In addition we analysed this specific RXR alpha/PPAR alpha site by Southwestern Blotting technique and could pin down three protein factors binding to this promoter element. By qPCR we could quantify the nutrigenomic effect of L-carnitine itself and fenofibrate. Conclusions: Our results indicate a cooperative interplay of L-carnitine and PPAR alpha in transcriptional regulation of murine CrAT, which is of nutrigenomical relevance. We created experimental proof that the muCrAT gene clearly is a PPARa target. Both L-carnitine and fenofibrate are inducers of CrAT transcripts, but the important hyperlipidemic drug fenofibrate being a more potent one, as a consequence of its pharmacological interaction.", "class": "Biochemistry"}, {"id": 10459, "input": "China's rapid economic development greatly affected not only the global economy but also the entire environment of the Earth.

Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered by the lack of long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current 'state of the art' in utilizing coral trace meatl proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution ( river discharge, land use changes, dredging and dumping, mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage). The three most commonly used coral trace element proxies (i.e., Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Y/Ca) are closely associated with river runoff in the Great Barrier Reef, but considerable uncertainty remains regarding their complex biogeochemical cycling and controlling mechanisms. However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution.

They are potentially useful for calibrating full-field digital mammography (FFDM) for quantitative analysis. This study uses ANN modeling to estimate volumetric breast density (VBD) from FFDM on Japanese women with and without breast cancer. ANN calibration of VBD was performed using phantom data for one FFDM system. Mammograms of 46 Japanese women diagnosed with invasive carcinoma and 53 with negative findings were analyzed using ANN models learned. ANN-estimated VBD was validated against phantom data, compared intra-patient, with qualitative composition scoring, with MRI VBD, and inter-patient with classical risk factors of breast cancer as well as cancer status. Phantom validations reached an R (2) of 0.993. Intra-patient validations ranged from R (2) of 0.789 with VBD to 0.908 with breast volume. ANN VBD agreed well with BI-RADS scoring and MRI VBD with R (2) ranging from 0.665 with VBD to 0.852 with breast volume. VBD was significantly higher in women with cancer.

(2) The design and application of adaptive filters on the residual signals, over time, in a sliding-window based incremental/decremental manner to smoothen the signals and to reduce the false positive rates. This gives us the freedom to tighten the tolerance band and thus to increase fault detection rates by holding the same level of false positives. In the results section, we verify that this increase is statistically significant in the case of adaptive filters when applying the proposed concepts onto four real-world scenarios (three different ones from rolling mills, one from engine test benches). The hybridization of sparse fuzzy inference systems with genetic algorithms led to the generation of more high quality models that can in turn be used in the FD process as residual generators. The new hybrid sparse memetic modeling approach also achieved fuzzy systems leading to higher fault detection rates for some scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the storage requirement, e.g. memory or disk usage, for implicit representations of complex models is relatively large. In this paper, we propose a compact representation for multilevel rational algebraic spline (MRAS) surfaces using low-rank tensor approximation technique, and exploit its applications in surface reconstruction. Given a set of 3D points equipped with oriented normals, we first fit them with an algebraic spline surface defined on a box that bounds the point cloud. We split the bounding box into eight sub-cells if the fitting error is greater than a given threshold. Then for each sub-cell over which the fitting error is greater than the threshold, an offset function represented by an algebraic spline function of low rank is computed by locally solving a convex optimization problem. An algorithm is presented to solve the optimization problem based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition of tensors. The procedure is recursively performed until a certain accuracy is achieved. To ensure the global continuity of the MRAS surface, quadratic B-spline weight functions are used to blend the offset functions. Numerous experiments show that our approach can greatly reduce the storage of the reconstructed implicit surface while preserve the fitting accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Satellite radar interferometry, or InSAR, offers a remote sensing technique to map mm-scale grotind deformation over wide areas given an archive of suitable multi-temporal data.

With the choice on the variable coefficients representing the delayed nonlinear response effect and nonlinearity, interactions between the amplitude- and velocity-unchanging, amplitude-changing, velocity-changing and amplitude- and velocity-changing vector two solitons are obtained.

Piezoelectric-shunt damping is an attractive technique for controlling the vibrating structures, which is reliable, economical and light-weight. Phononic crystal is an internal component whose elastic constant, density and sound velocity change periodically. When the elastic wave passes through a phononic crystal, special dispersion curve is formed due to the interaction of periodic arrangement materials. In order to study the electromagnetic oscillation band gap of the piezoelectric phononic crystal with LCR shunt network at torsional and flexural vibration, we propose a new phononic piezoelectric beam, which is composed of aluminum and epoxy resin. When the piezoelectric patch is strained, the electrical energy is dissipated as current flows through an external LCR shunting circuit. By combining the piezoelectric effect with the mechanical vibration of the smart material, the equivalent additional stress of piezoelectric patches is deduced. Moreover, coupling the energy band theory of phononic crystal with the effect of electromagnetic oscillation, we calculate the band gap characteristics of torsional and flexural vibration of intelligent material. Using the transfer matrix method and Bloch theorem for periodic boundary conditions, the band gap of the phononic beam can be calculated. With the increase of resistance, the amplitude attenuation of the band gap decreases. However, it can expand the frequency range. The inherent frequency of the electromagnetic oscillation is 1/[2 pi root L(C + C-P)]. The sum of capacitance and inherent capacitance is the total capacitance of the shunting circuit. Therefore, the frequency of the electromagnetic oscillation decreases with the increases of the capacitance and inductance. The amplitude attenuation of the band gap increases with the increase of the inductance and decreases greatly with the rise of the capacitance. Three main differences between the LCR shunt networks and traditional circuits are found. First, the band gaps of the phononic piezoelectric smart material are composed of Bragg band gaps and local resonant band gaps. The former one is due to the mismatch between aluminum and epoxy resin, which makes the elastic waves have no corresponding vibration modes at certain frequencies. The latter one is from the effect of electromagnetic oscillation in LCR shunt networks, which consume the energy by resistor. Second, by tuning the resistance, capacitance and inductance, we can change the singularity position and stress magnitude of equivalent additional force curve. The amplitude attenuations of locally resonant band gaps and electromechanical coupling coefficient will be changed. Third, both locations and widths of the band gaps can be tuned by simply varying the value of negative capacitance of the shunting networks without needing to modify the configuration of the structure.

During the last two decades, malaria transmission has been mostly local and isolated to a few regions. It is important to gain further insights into the impact of control measures on the parasite population structure. Hence, the aim of the current study was to determine detailed changes in P. vivax genetic diversity and population structure based on analysing the gene that encodes the apical membrane antigen 1 (pvama1). This analysis covered from control to pre-elimination (1993-2011) in a hypo-endemic region in southern Mexico. Results: The 213 pvama1I-II sequences presently analysed were grouped into six periods of three years each. They showed low genetic diversity, with 15 haplotypes resolved. Among the DNA sequences, there was a gradual decrease in genetic diversity, the number of mixed genotype infections and the intensity of positive selection, in agreement with the parallel decline in malaria cases. At the same time, linkage disequilibrium (R-2) increased. The three-dimensional haplotype network revealed that pvama1I-II haplotypes were separated by 1-11 mutational steps, and between one another by 0-3 unsampled haplotypes. In the temporal network, seven haplotypes were detected in at least two of the six-time layers, and only four distinct haplotypes were evidenced in the pre-elimination phase. Structure analysis indicated that three subpopulations fluctuated over time. Only 8.5% of the samples had mixed ancestry. In the pre-elimination phase, subpopulation P1 was drastically reduced, and the admixture was absent. Conclusions: The results suggest that P. vivax in southern Mexico evolved based on local adaptation into three \"pseudoclonal\" subpopulations that diversified at the regional level and persisted over time, although with varying frequency. Control measures and climate events influenced the number of malaria cases and the genetic structure. The sharp decrease in parasite diversity and other related genetic parameters during the pre-elimination phase suggests that malaria elimination is possible in the near future.

Such capabilities will allow Airavata services to be deployed in a wide area, large Virtual Machine (VM) based cluster, and a developer's laptop. The emerging technologies in cloud computing and Big Data that address these needs are the following: Docker, Marathon, and Apache Mesos. Docker is a Linux-based lightweight container that allows different applications to run isolated from each other but safely share the machine's resources. Docker images of applications can be published in registries and retrieved for execution in the target infrastructures. Marathon provides a cluster-wide init and control system for services, including Docker containers. Mesos provides a cluster-wide framework to schedule tasks based on fine-grained resource needs. Mesosphere provides the packages, scripts, and web interface to ease the use of these technologies. We present the design, experience, and lessons learned from integrating Mesos, Docker, and Marathon with Apache Airavata.

The risk of-parasitism hypothesis predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory, risk-taking) individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk of parasite exposure. In contrast, the pace-of-life hypothesis argues that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically, associations between immunity and personality can arise because personality differences are often associated with differences in condition and stress responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus. We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites (none detected), chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT, in a subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life hypothesis, and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness did not underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune function in more proactive individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This research attempts to gain benefits of Bayesian classifier through development of a Bayesian Classifier-Based Energy Aware Routing algorithm (BBEAR) for mobile WSNs. Through implementing a Bayesian classifier for routing process, a superior routing algorithm is designed with an intelligent node message rebroadcast decision. This paper discusses the proposed algorithm design and presents a comparison of its performance with flooding technique. BBEAR workflow is described, along with its classifier mechanism that allows the message routing judgment by each sensor node to be based on several node's and message's classifying attributes. In contrast to other routing schemes developed for WSN, BBEAR algorithm incorporates several node attributes, including: remaining energy that the nodes have, distance to the sink, number of messages being queued, node's success rate, delay of the received message, as well as the number of message duplicates received by the node. The BBEAR performance is also discussed and evaluated in terms of various measures such as: throughput, number of duplicates received, average delay, and the lifetime of the nodes. The simulation study of the proposed algorithm shows its superiority over flooding: as it provides 15% gain in message throughput, four times reduction of duplicates, and gives an extension of 60% nodes' lifetime while still maintaining the delay and delay jitter at low levels.", "class": "Computer Science"}, {"id": 33686, "input": "The article presents strength's analysis of toroidal pressure tank using FEM.

Despite being a major determinant in the lifespan of porous pavements, there is limited information on the physical clogging processes through these systems. The aim of this study was to understand the main physical processes that govern physical clogging and develop a simple black-box model that predicts physical clogging. The key variables that were hypothesised to influence clogging were pavement design and climate characteristics. Two compressed time scale laboratory experiments were conducted over 3 years on three common porous pavement types; monolithic porous asphalt, modular Hydrapave and monolithic Permapave. Pavement design was found to be an important role in clogging. Permapave did not clog even after 26 years of operation in simulated sub-tropical Brisbane (Australia) climate while porous asphalt and Hydrapave clogged after just 12 years, from surface clogging and geotextile clogging, respectively. Each system was tested using two different dosing patterns: (1) continual wetting with no dry periods and (2) variable inflow rates with drying periods (i.e. representing more natural conditions). The latter dosing method approximately doubled the lifespan of all systems suggesting the influence of climate conditions on clogging. Clogging was found to be highly correlated with cumulative volume and flow rate. A simple black-box regression model that predicts physical clogging was developed as a function of cumulative volume and Brisbane climatic conditions. However it is very likely that the shape of this regression is general, and that it could be calibrated for different climates in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the functional view of the system, the first level of information processing is managed by marking agents which leave marks in the environment in correspondence to the users' positions. The accumulation of marks enables a stigmergic cooperation mechanism, generating short-term memory structures in the local environment. Information provided by such structures is granulated by event agents which associate a certainty degree with each event. Finally, an inference level, managed by situation agents, deduces user situations from the underlying events by exploiting fuzzy rules whose parameters are generated automatically by a neuro-fuzzy approach. Fuzziness allows the system to cope with the uncertainty of the events.

At times this question generated major controversies with largely diverging opinions. Basically, mechanistic thinkers, who tried to understand organismic functions in terms of nonliving machines, were opposed by those who tried to describe specific properties or even special forces being active within living entities. As this question included the human body, these controversies always have been of special relevance to our self-image and also touched practical issues of medicine. During the second half of the twentieth century, it seemed to be resolved that organisms are explainable basically as physicochemical machines. Especially from the perspective of molecular biology, it seemed to be clear that organisms need to be explained solely by the chemical functions of their component parts, although some resistance to this view never ceased. This research program has been working quite successfully, so that science today knows a lot about the physiological and chemical processes within organisms. However, again new doubts arise questioning whether the mere continuation of this analytical approach will finally generate a fundamental understanding of living entities. At the beginning of the twenty-first century the quest for a new synthesis actually comes from analytical empiricists themselves.

After that, simulation cases are also conducted to show the influence of solar radiation on the thermal status of individual clothed body segments when the human body is staying indoors in different seasons. This numerical simulation method provides a useful tool to analyze the thermal status of clothed human body under different solar radiation incidences indoors and thus enables the architect to efficiently utilize the green solar energy in building development.

The design parameters include two phase pressure drop, mixing and axial mixing in both the phases, effective interfacial area, heat and mass transfer coefficients. Currently, there is a high degree of empiricism in the design process of such reactors owing to the complexity of coupled flow and reaction mechanism. Hence, we focus on synthesizing recent advances in computational and experimental techniques that will enable future designs of such reactors in a more rational manner by exploring a large design space with high-fidelity models (computational fluid dynamics) that are validated with high-fidelity measurements (hot film anemometry (HFA), Laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), particle image velocimetry (Ply), etc.) to provide a high degree of rigor. Understanding the spatial distributions of dispersed phases and their interaction during scale up are key challenges that were traditionally addressed through pilot scale experiments, but now can be addressed through advanced modelling. For practically complete knowledge of the fluid mechanical parameters, it is desirable to implement direct numerical simulations (DNS). However, the current computational power does not permit full DNS for real bubble columns. Therefore, we have been using simplified turbulence models (such as large eddy simulation, Reynolds stress, k-epsilon, etc.) which need the knowledge of turbulence parameters. For the estimation of these parameters, currently semi-empirical procedures are being used pending the knowledge of turbulence. Further, the formulation of governing equations in all the CFD models (except DNS), the knowledge of interface forces (drag, lift, virtual mass, Basset, etc.) is needed and for their estimations empirical correlations are being employed, again pending the knowledge of fluid mechanics under turbulent conditions in bubble columns. In gas liquid dispersions, the gas is sparged in the form of bubbles. During the bubble rise, the mechanism of wake detachment creates turbulence which can be called as wake generated turbulence. In addition, energy gets transferred from the gas phase to liquid phase. The quantitative amounts are negligible when bubble motion is not hindered and the gas liquid dispersion is homogenous. The amounts increase with an increase in the extent of hindrance. However, in the homogenous regime, even under extreme conditions, the extent of energy transfer in the bulk gas liquid dispersions (volume other than wake volume) is fairly limited. On contrast, in the heterogeneous regime, the rates of energy transfer become sizeable. The energy received by the liquid (in both the regimes) also creates turbulent motion and termed as bulk generated turbulence. In turbulent flows a compendium of eddies (flow structures) of different length and time scales contribute towards improved/enhanced mixing, momentum transfer, heat transfer, and mass transfer (transport phenomena). Hence, a proper understanding of the dynamics of these turbulent flow structures, and their role in the transport phenomena, can bring substantial improvement in the scale-up and design procedures. The present paper brings out the current status of knowledge on bubble generated turbulence. All the published literature in experimental measurements and DNS simulations has been critically analysed and coherently presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to miR398, miR408, miR319, and miR160 are also responsive to sucrose. Furthermore, the induction of miR398 and miR408 by sucrose depends on the presence of SPL7. MiR398 and miR408 induction by high sucrose was eliminated by high copper. Meanwhile, high sucrose treatment strongly suppressed copper accumulation. Knock-down of SPL7 dramatically reduced copper accumulation in plants under low sucrose, but this effect was corn promised in the presence of high levels of sucrose.

Xylem anatomy in woody tissue is a promising source of information in tree-rings since it is closely linked to tree hydraulics and carbon fixation. However, despite the rising interest for cell anatomy in dendrochronology, still little is known about the interpretation of the variability of cell anatomical responses observed across different environments and species. Here we analyze cell anatomical responses to increasing summer drought on 18 trees from 3 conifer species (Picea obovata, Pinus sylvestris, and Larix sibirica) growing in the transition zone between forest and steppe in the Republic of Khakassia (Russia). Analyses include the comparison of tracheid size distributions along climatic gradients and contrasting micro-topography from 1986 to 2008. Results indicate an overall decrease of earlywood tracheid lumen and cell wall thickness to high temperature and drought regardless of species and site conditions. In particular an increase of one degree Celsius during the summer caused up to 5% reduction of earlywood cell lumen and wall thickness. These anatomical shifts suggest that a downscaling of hydraulic efficiency is not paralleled by increased hydraulic safety, presumably due to carbon limitation. Based on the results of this case study, we suggest that increasing drought stress might hamper the formation of a functional xylem structure, thus being a possible trigger for a miss-acclimation causing long-term decline and higher exposure to hydraulic failures. Despite the promising study approach, more studies including more data (trees, years) and broader climatic gradients would be needed to further improve our mechanistic understanding.

Consequently, a mix employing a foaming agent with a dilution rate of 2% (#1) showed a better drain performance than all the other mixes, because it had the most appropriately formed and distributed open-cell foams, the key component for tunnel drainage. In other words, the mix of dilution rate of 2% was thought to have achieved stable closed-cell foams because of the decline in the surface tension of the foams, as well as the optimal formation and distribution of open-cell foams that possess excellent permeability because of the cohesiveness between the foams. Moreover, the thickness (drainage space) of it was approximately 17 times that of the nonwoven geotextile, and because the closed-cell and open-cell foams were connected like a spider web, it could be expected to reduce the blocking of drainage caused by the fines of soil.

In this study, we used an independent genetic marker, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences, to screen genetic variation in established and adjacent outbreak populations in southeastern Australia.

The fidelity of siRNA release from the commonly used pri-miRNA shuttles was found to depend on both the siRNA insert and the pri-miR scaffold. Then, we searched for specific factors that may affect the precision of siRNA release and found that both the structural features of shmiR hairpins and the nucleotide sequence at Drosha and Dicer processing sites contribute to cleavage site selection and cleavage precision.

In contrast to soluble BMPs which can interact with their receptors at the dorsal side of the cell, BMPs presented as an insoluble cue physically bound to a biomimetic matrix, called here matrix-bound (bBMP-2), are presented to cells by their ventral side. To date, BMP-2 internalization and signaling studies in cell biology have always been performed by adding soluble (sBMP-2) to cells adhered on cell culture plates or glass slides, which will be considered here as a \"reference\" condition. However, whether and how matrix-bound BMP-2 can be internalized by cells and its relation to canonical (SMAD) and non canonical signaling (ALP) remain open questions. In this study, we investigated the uptake and processing of BMP-2 by C2C12 myoblasts. This BMP-2 was presented either embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayer films (matrix-bound presentation) or as soluble form. Using fluorescently labeled BMP-2, we showed that the amount of matrix-bound BMP-2 internalized is dependent on the level of crosslinking of the polyelectrolyte films. Cav-1-mediated internalization is related to both SMAD and ALP signaling, while clathrin-mediated is only related to ALP signaling. BMP-2 internalization was independent of the presentation mode (sBMP-2 versus bBMP-2) for low crosslinked films (soft, EDC10) in striking contrast with high crosslinked (stiff, EDC70) films where internalization was much lower and slower for bBMP-2. As anticipated, internalization of sBMP-2 barely depended on the underlying matrix. Taken together, these results indicate that BMP-2 internalization can be tuned by the underlying matrix and activates downstream BMP-2 signaling, which is key for the effective formation of bone tissue. Statement of Significance The presentation of growth factors from material surfaces currently presents significant challenges in academic research, clinics and industry. Being able to deliver efficiently these growth factors by a biomaterial will open new perspectives for regenerative medicine. However, to date, very little is known about how matrix-bound growth factors are delivered to cells, especially whether they are internalized and how they are signaling to drive key differentiation events. These initial steps are crucial as they will guide the subsequent processes leading to tissue regeneration. In this work, we investigate the uptake and processing by cells of BMP-2 ligands embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayer films in comparison to soluble BMP-2. We show that BMP-2 responsive cells can internalize matrix-bound BMP-2 and that internalization is dependent on the cross-linking level of the polyelectrolyte films. In addition, we show that internalization is mediated by both clathrin- and caveolin-dependent pathways. While inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis affects only non-canonical signaling, blocking caveolin-1-dependent endocytosis reduces both canonical and non-canonical BMP signaling. The signaling pathways found for matrix-bound BMP-2 are similar to those found for soluble BMP-2. These results highlight that BMP-2 presented by a biomaterial at the ventral side of the cell can trigger major endocytic and associated signaling pathways leading to bone regeneration.

In particular, an inner-city diesel-electric hybrid bus and an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) powered forklift truck will be used as case studies. Computer prediction of fuel consumption and emissions of automotive vehicles on standardised drive cycles is well-established and commercial software packages such as AVL CRUISE have been specifically developed for this purpose. The vehicles considered in this review paper present new challenges from both the simulation and drive-cycle testing perspectives. For example, in the case of the forklift truck, the drive cycles involve reversing elements, variable mass, lifting operations, and do not specify a precise velocity-time profile. In particular, the difficulties associated with the prediction of productivity, i.e. the maximum rate of completing a series of defined operations, are discussed.

The need to incorporate genetic data into conservation management decisions is increasingly recognised.

Two endemic palm species of the Itremo Massif in central Madagascar, Dypsis ambositrae and D. decipiens, are known to be threatened with extinction and conservation management for these species is a priority for the newly created protected area in the region. Methods. The genetic diversity of these two species was studied using the relatively low-cost and rapid AFLP technique. DNA fragments generated using three primer combinations were analysed for 20 and 50 individuals of the two species, respectively, from across their ranges. Results. Genetic diversity was relatively low for both species. The two sites where the highly restricted D. ambositrae grows were found to be genetically distinct (although overall heterozygosity was low). Despite having a much wider distribution and relatively large population, D. decipiens did not show clear geographical nor genetic groupings and had similarly low genetic heterozygosity to D. ambositrae. Discussion and Recommendations. With so few individuals remaining in the wild and two genetically distinct subpopulations, it is recommended that both sites of D.ambositrae are conserved and that seed are collected from both for ex situ conservation and potential future reintroduction.

The method is based on potable water savings, embodied energy, energy consumption for operation, and investment feasibility analysis; and it was applied to a school in the city of Florianopolis, southern Brazil. The strategies considered to save potable water were rainwater, greywater, water-efficient appliances, and their combinations. The embodied energy was estimated using indices of embodied energy per mass of material, and labour. The indicators used to rank the strategies were potential for potable water savings, index between potable water savings and embodied energy or total energy consumption, net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback, and index between potable water savings and initial costs. All strategies and combinations were feasible, but the use of water-efficient appliances was the best. Amongst the indicators used to rank the strategies, five of them led to the same ranking. Such indicators can be applied to rank potable water saving strategies in other types of buildings and climates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Value-added utilisation of C&DW in geosynthetic-reinforced structures is almost an unexplored field. This paper presents the results of physical, mechanical and environmental characterisation of recycled C&DW, as well as the direct shear behaviour of three recycled C&DW-geosynthetic interfaces.

The environmental characterisation of the C&DW, carried out through leaching tests, did not show environmental concerns. Direct shear test results have demonstrated that properly selected and compacted C&DW can exhibit shear strength similar to natural soils.

Results: In the present study, we developed a high efficiency Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation system for M. thermophila, including an approach for targeted gene deletion using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a marker for selection. Up to 145 transformants per 10(5) conidia were obtained in one transformation plate. Moreover, a ku70 deletion mutant was constructed in the ATCC 42464 background using the tools developed in present study and subsequently characterized. The ku70 deletion construct was designed using resistance to phosphinothricin as the selection marker. Additionally, a GFP-encoding cassette was incorporated that allowed for the selection of site-specific (no fluorescence) or ectopic (fluorescence) integration of the ku70 construct. Transformants with ectopically integrated ku70 deletion constructs were therefore identified using the fluorescent signal of GFP. PCR and Southern blotting analyses of non-fluorescent putative ku70 deletion transformants revealed all 11 tested transformants to be correct deletions. The deletion frequency in a pool of 116 transformants analyzed was 58 %. Moreover, the homologous rate improved about 3 folds under ku70 mutant using the pyrG as a test gene to disrupt in M. thermophila. Conclusions: We successfully developed an efficient transformation and target gene disruption approach for M. thermophila ATCC 42464 mediated by A. tumefaciens.

The optimum dose of each flocculant was determined using the jar test. Additionally, pressure filtration tests were performed to determine the dewatering rates and filter cake properties. Test results showed that the flocculants' properties, especially charge density, have a significant effect on the optimum dose.

Using experimental approach based on scanning probe microscopy, individual molecules can be directly wired between two metallic contacts, and their conductance can be determined. ET behavior of the peptides and proteins can be analyzed in terms of their applicability as molecular wires, switches, diodes and elements of sensing devices.

The role of the cofactor as the initiator of reactive free radicals needed for these reactions is well established. Less clear is how these enzymes activate the coenzyme towards homolysis and control the radicals once generated. The availability of high resolution X-ray structures combined with detailed kinetic and spectroscopic analyses have allowed several adenosylcobalamin enzymes to be computationally modeled in some detail. Computer simulations have generally obtained good agreement with experimental data and provided valuable insight into the mechanisms of these unusual reactions. Importantly, atomistic modeling of the enzymes has allowed the role of specific interactions between protein, substrate and coenzyme to be explored, leading to mechanistic predictions that can now be tested experimentally.

Currently the main interest is devoted to the characteristics of these materials and little consideration has been given to their preparation. Solution combustion synthesis (SCS) is considered a green and sustainable alternative to the widely employed energy-and/or time-consuming synthesis methods. In this study, SCS was employed to prepare Bi2Ti2O7 and to perform bandgap engineering through foreign ion (Fe, Mn) incorporation. The synthesized materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy, and surface area determination via N-2 adsorption. We found that nanocrystalline materials were formed during the SCS synthesis. Further, the phase composition of these materials and the amount of the foreign metal ions incorporated in the parent structure, could be effectively controlled. Consequently, the SCS technique provided a simple and reliable tool for bandgap engineering.

We hypothesised that fruit nutrient levels would increase more when an organic mulch, containing nutrients, was applied to the soil, with smaller/no increases when an inorganic mulch was applied to the tree row. In this paper, we concentrate on changes in fruit phosphorus (P) concentrations after application of five treatments: a clean cultivated control, an inorganic woven geotextile fabric, and organic mulches - compost, wood chips and a vermi-castings/wood chips combination. The trial was conducted on a commercial farm, Lourensford Estate, South Africa, from October 2008 to April 2012 - on an adjacent light, sandy and heavier, sandy-silt soil. Mineral nutrient analyses of the soil, leaves, mulches and fruit were performed. Yield and fruit size were determined. Soil temperatures and soil water status were recorded hourly during the last two seasons. P concentrations did increase chronologically from the soil, then into leaves and then into the fruit after application of mulches that provided additional P to the soil. Sporadic increases in both leaves and fruit occurred, but could not always be related to treatment effects. The significant consistent increase of P levels of the vermi- castings treatment in the heavy soil is likely to be a combination of reduced irrigation volumes, as well as a treatment effect. All mulches resulted in the well-established buffering of soil temperatures, soil water content and percentage soil carbon. Based on results from this study, it is not feasible to apply mulches for the sole purpose to increase P levels in the soil, leaves or fruit of established trees - although increases were noticed from time to time. In addition to water and temperature modifying effects of mulches that would differ between soil textures and depend on the mulch source, increases in P concentrations may result. As yield efficiency is still the primary factor determining income per hectare for the producer, the decrease in yield that resulted from mulching under these conditions, will still outweigh any positive contributions of mulches.

The possibility of an unthrottled engine operating with a substantially lower cycle-to-cycle variation compared to both gasoline and ethanol decomposition is demonstrated. At high loads, the injector flow area was insufficient for a low injection pressure of 40 bar, leading to late injection and reduced engine efficiency for methanol steam reforming products. In the case of ethanol decomposition, the problem was less severe due to the higher energy content of ethanol decomposition products per mole.

The importance of discharge observation has increased due to its potential extreme variation resulting from the projected climate change and stronger variability of precipitation and temperature in some large basins. However, inherent difficulties in ground-based observations and decreasing number of gauge stations hinder accurate measurement of global river discharge and its spatio-temporal variations. Various remote sensing methods have been examined as alternatives, however, they require ground measurements to convert their proxy measurements into the actual river discharge. In this study, we estimate the discharge at the Obidos station and the mouth of the Amazon basin using the water storage variations derived from GRACE gravity data without relying on any auxiliary ground observations. We extract the water mass signal along the main stem of the river by applying the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) for water storage variations over the basin. The relative water storage variations along the main stem derived from the EOF decomposition are highly correlated with in-situ discharge at the Obidos. However, in high water season, the GRACE-based discharge is estimated larger than the in-situ observations, and the difference is particularly significant during the 2009 extreme flood season. We argue that the in-situ river discharge in 2009 was underestimated due to the missed water volume for the flow detouring around the Obidos gauge station during the high-flow event. Net river discharge of the Amazon Basin to Atlantic Ocean is also estimated, and its annual discharge is about 23% larger than that of the Obidos.

It is, therefore, appropriate to employ the paradigm of \"computing with words\" (CWWs), which aims to mimic the ability of humans to communicate transparently and manipulate perceptions via words. One of the daily activities that would increase the comfort levels of the users (especially people with disabilities) is cooking and performing tasks in the kitchen. Existing approaches on food preparation, cooking, and recipe recommendation stress on healthy eating and balanced meal choices while providing limited personalization features through the use of intrusive user interfaces. Herein, we present an application, which transparently interacts with users based on a novel CWWs approach in order to predict the recipe's difficulty level and to recommend an appropriate recipe depending on the user's mood, appetite, and spare time.

This research contributes to the current body of knowledge by introducing a two-prong strategy for estimating optimal productivity in labor-intensive construction operations and by applying this strategy to a pilot study on the replacement of electrical lighting fixtures. The first prong, or top-down approach, estimates the upper limit of optimal productivity by introducing system inefficiencies into the productivity frontier-the productivity achieved under perfect conditions. This study uses a qualitative factor model to identify this upper limit. The second prong, or bottom-up approach, estimates the lower limit of optimal productivity by taking away operational inefficiencies from actual productivity-productivity recorded in the field. A discrete-event simulation model provides this lower-limit value. An average of the upper and lower limits yields the best estimate of optimal productivity. This paper reviews relevant literature, presents the details of both the top-down and bottom-up approaches, analyzes the data from a pilot project, evaluates the feasibility of this two-prong strategy, and finally provides a novel framework for project managers who want to accurately estimate the optimal productivity of their labor-intensive construction operations.

Therefore, governments have been heavily incentivising the market to switch to electric passenger cars in order to reduce air pollution. However, this literature review suggests that electric vehicles may not reduce levels of PM as much as expected, because of their relatively high weight. By analysing the existing literature on non-exhaust emissions of different vehicle categories, this review found that there is a positive relationship between weight and non-exhaust PM emission factors. In addition, electric vehicles (EVs) were found to be 24% heavier than equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). As a result, total PM10 emissions from EVs were found to be equal to those of modern ICEVs. PM2.5 emissions were only 1-3% lower for EVs compared to modern ICEVs. Therefore, it could be concluded that the increased popularity of electric vehicles will likely not have a great effect on PM levels. Non exhaust emissions already account for over 90% of PM10 and 85% of PM2.5 emissions from traffic. These proportions will continue to increase as exhaust standards improve and average vehicle weight increases. Future policy should consequently focus on setting standards for non-exhaust emissions and encouraging weight reduction of all vehicles to significantly reduce PM emissions from traffic.

The proposed technique is based on the evaluation of the closed-loop transient responses of both axes of the synchronous reference frame when a proportional-integral current controller is implemented. The method gives a set of resistance and inductance values that should be employed for a rigorous design of the current controllers.

The thermal radiation is simulated using the P-1-model. The numerical model and the thermal coupling strategy, suitable for a transient solver, is described. Such numerical coupling requires that the radiative equation is solved several times at each iteration; hence, the computational cost of the radiative model is a crucial issue. The P-1-model is adopted because of its particularly fast computation. First, a collection of benchmark cases is presented and used to carefully validate the radiation model against literature results and to analyse the model prediction limits. Despite the simplicity of the model, it satisfactorily reproduces the thermal radiation effects. Some lack of accuracy is identified in particular cases. Second, a number of benchmark cases are described and adopted to investigate fluid-solid thermal interaction in the presence of radiation. Three cases are designed, to couple radiation with: pure conduction, conduction and forced convection, conduction and natural convection. In all the cases, the surface radiative heat transfer strongly influences the system thermodynamics, leading to a significant increase of the fluid-solid interface temperature. The main non dimensional numbers, related to the mutual influence of the different heat transfer modes, are introduced and employed in the analyses. A new conduction-radiation parameter is derived in order to study the conductive boundary layer in absence of convective heat transfer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonlinear system identification methods are considered that use a parametric, nonlinear, physics-based model of the system, cast in the state-space framework. Various nonlinear filters and parameter learning algorithms can then be used to recover the parameters and quantify uncertainty. This paper focuses on the particle filter (PF), which shows the advantage of not assuming Gaussianity of the posterior densities. However, the PF is known to behave poorly in high dimensional spaces, especially when static parameters are added to the state vector. To improve the efficiency of the PF, the concept of Rao-Blackwellisation is applied, that is, we use conditional linearities present in the equations to marginalize out some of the states/parameters and infer their conditional posterior pdf using the Kalman filtering equations. This method has been studied extensively in the particle filtering literature, and we start our discussion by improving upon and applying two well-known algorithms on a benchmark structural system. Then, noticing that in structural systems, high nonlinearities are often localized while the remaining equations are bilinear in the states and parameters, a novel algorithm is proposed, which combines this marginalization approach with a second-order extended Kalman filter. This new approach enables us to marginalize out all the states/parameters, which do not contribute to any high nonlinearity in the equations and, thus, improve identification of the unknown parameters.

Step-by-step analysis of this effect is carried out by decoupling the self-heating and impact-ionization effects that cause the turning ON of the parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and subsequently the snapback effect. It is observed that for LDMOS transistors with low t(BOX), V-sb increases with increase in t(BOX) due to reduction in drain current density as well as reduced impact ionization at higher lattice temperature. On the other hand, for high t(BOX), V-sb reduces with the increase in t(BOX) due to early switching ON of the parasitic BJT at higher temperature. Therefore, it is possible to find an optimum value of t(BOX) to obtain the highest V-sb for an SOI-LDMOS transistor.

This is shown in the development of functionally coated cylinder liners and crankcases for ultra light weight engines as well as for ceramic coated bioinert and biodegradable substrates in medical surgery. It will be shown that cast engine block bores can be directly coated by using an automated HVOF process, obtaining improved coating results. The internal coating process by hypersonic flame spraying is a superior technological alternative to the APS process for high quality cylinder liner and engine crankcase applications.

These challenges include lack of student value & utilization of course objectives & assessment tools, sponsor retention & funding issues, and large instructional demands. Many of these challenges may be addressed by placing a larger and more genuine emphasis on assessing the product of the design project, not only the process by which the design occurs. Oregon State University's (OSU) Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering capstone course currently organizes, manages, and evaluates capstone projects using the House of Quality (HoQ). In general, the HoQ is a tool used to relate project requirements to design performance specifications. Additionally, at OSU the HoQ serves as (i) a contract between students, sponsors, course instructors, and faculty advisers detailing exactly what is required from the design project, (ii) a guiding tool to allow students to self-monitor their progress throughout the course, and (iii) an objective means of evaluating the students' performance in terms of the product produced by their capstone design projects. This paper describes the OSU course, introduces the HoQ, and presents a time-line of the implementation of product assessment at OSU. Key changes are shown during the move from a purely process based assessment framework to the current state where 50% of total points in the design implementation term of the capstone course are awarded based on the student design team accomplishing design product metrics per sponsor defined design requirements.

In terms of improving or enhancing occupant well-being, a unique case emerges for healthcare facilities, whose main existence is based on the principles of improving the health of their patients. In the U.S., the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system has become the most widely recognized and used certification system for green buildings, including green hospital buildings. However, hospitals with high total scores may be green buildings but not necessarily the optimal green healthcare environment from a patient's wellbeing perspective. The goal of the study was to identify whether hospitals and healthcare facilities actually value the specific criteria that influence the health of patients and their recovery period. In-depth analysis of LEED healthcare specific credits revealed general tendencies and practices for green healthcare buildings. Based on a statistical analysis, the mean of percent healthcare specific scores were calculated as 48% for those certified under LEED Healthcare, 62% for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v3, and 52% for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v2 rating systems. While hospitals included in the Healthcare category were initially expected to be the most successful ones in terms of achieving patient recovery and wellbeing related credits, they proved to earn the lowest percent of relevant points in this analysis. The result may be attributed to heightened restrictions and requirements of credits in the Healthcare scorecard, or hospitals may be valuing the level of certification more than those credits that were deemed relevant for patient wellbeing and rate of recovery, either due to lack of information or due to economic constraints. A high correlation coefficient was calculated among total scores and healthcare specific scores for the Healthcare dataset. On the other hand, correlation coefficients calculated for the other two datasets indicate a more random pattern among the two variables.

While doing so, the thermal power plants produce about 117 million tons per year of coal ash as waste materials. Improper disposal of this ash poses a threat to the environment. It requires allocation of vast land area for dumping/storing and it pollutes the land. Ash generated in thermal power plants falls into two categories, namely, fly ash and pond ash. One of the ways to minimize the harmful effects due to unsafe disposal of ash on the environment is to utilize the ash in the construction industry as an admixture in brick making, cement manufacture, etc. Moreover, in the conventional brick making, a precious natural soil resource is overexploited. One of the essential requirements of green building is to use environmentally friendly building materials as well as to reuse/ recycle industrial waste products like fly ash and pond ash. If the fly ash and pond ash are used optimally by replacing clay in the brick-manufacturing industry, then this waste material can be treated as greener material. This will also reduce the pressure on the excavation of soil. Besides energy-saving methodologies, green building involves the application of all technologies and using of materials without affecting the natural resources. In this investigation, an attempt was made to devise ways for the optimal use of pond ash in manufacturing coal-ash bricks. This article presents the experimental results for coal ash brick made up of pond ash with fly ash, lime, gypsum, and stone dust.

There is controversy about the ideal surgical management of a massive rotator cuff tear with pseudoparalysis. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze the ability to reverse pseudoparalysis with an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). The hypothesis was that in the absence of substantial glenohumeral arthritis, preoperative fatty infiltration of grade 3 or higher and an acromiohumeral interval (AHI) of less than 7 mm would not prevent reversal of pseudoparalysis with an ARCR. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A prospective multicenter study of ARCR performed for preoperative pseudoparalysis was conducted. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. The mean patient age was 63 years, and pseudoparalysis was present for a mean of 4.2 months preoperatively. Preoperative radiographic evaluation included plain film evaluation of the AHI and Hamada classification and MRI evaluation of fatty degeneration and rotator cuff retraction. Functional outcome was determined by the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score, visual analog scale (VAS), and subjective shoulder value (SSV). Results: Of the 58 patients enrolled, 56 had at least 1 year of follow-up. Mean active forward flexion improved from 47 degrees preoperatively to 159 degrees postoperatively (P < .001). Statistically significant improvements were seen in the SST (from 2.8 preoperatively to 10.1 postoperatively), SSV (from 28 to 83), ASES Shoulder Score (from 37 to 88), and VAS (from 5.7 to 1.1) (P < .001). Pseudoparalysis was reversed in 53 of 56 patients (95%). There was no difference in the rate of reversal of pseudoparalysis between those patients with an AHI of less than 7 mm (88.2%) and those with an AHI of 7 mm or more (96.9%) (P =.289). Pseudoparalysis was reversed in all 8 of the patients with fatty degeneration of grade 3 or higher in 1 or more of the rotator cuff muscles. Conclusion: ARCR can lead to reversal of preoperative pseudoparalysis in patients with minimal preoperative glenohumeral arthritis. ARCR is a viable first line of treatment for patients with pseudoparalysis in the absence of advanced glenohumeral arthritis.", "class": "Civil Engineering"}, {"id": 45002, "input": "Water reuse systems have been widely implemented across the globe as a solution to water shortage and freshwater contamination. Ongoing controversies regarding supposedly high energy cost and the lack of sufficient data to support benefits of water reuse are delaying further expansion of implementation of water reuse systems in South Korea. In order to clarify the ambiguity regarding the energy demand and provide an unbiased comparison between the water reuse alternatives and the conventional water supply system, energy consumptions and greenhouse gas emissions in operation phases of different water reuse facilities and the conventional water supply system were examined. The average total energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emission of the conventional process were calculated to be 0.511 kWh/m3 and 0.43 kgCO2e/m3, respectively. Centralized wastewater reuse systems had prohibitively high energy consumptions (1.224-1.914 kWh/m3) and greenhouse gas emissions (0.72-0.83 kgCO2e/ m3). The decentralized wastewater reuse systems, greywater reuse and rainwater harvesting systems, all used for non-potable purposes, had comparable or higher energy demands than the conventional process (0.246-0.970 kWh/m3 after adjustment), although estimated greenhouse gas emissions from these processes were lower than the conventional process (0-0.33 kgCO2e/m3 after adjustment). Considering the hidden environmental benefit (0.357 kWh/m3) from reduction of contaminant release, the energy demand of greywater reuse drops far below that of the conventional system, suggesting that decentralized water reuse is the key to an energy-efficient water management with minimal impact on climate change.

This three-point dynamic bending test was designed for testing the strength of materials under dynamic loads. It is carried out on a specimen consisting of a beam placed on two supports, which is subjected to an impact. The use of Hopkinson Bar as supports makes it possible to determine the forces and displacements at these points. An analytical solution for the transient response of a long beam subjected to a transverse impact was used to determine the impact force and the displacement. This procedure applies for the first few instants when the motions generated by the impact have not yet reached the supports, and the mechanical state of the specimen is identical to that of an unsupported beam. It is suitable for use with quasi-brittle materials for which failure occurs at the very beginning of the test. The material strength is determined at the time of failure, which is characterised by a sudden decrease in the bending moment. The results of a test in which a quasi-brittle material was loaded up to failure are presented and analysed as outlined above. The results obtained confirm the relevance of the present method.

This work extends our previously proposed dual-site Langmuir adsorption model to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption analytically from the observed adsorption isotherms for high pressure methane adsorption isotherms on Longmaxi shale from Sichuan, China (up to 27 MPa and 355.15 K). The calculated isosteric heat of adsorption considers both the real gas behavior of bulk methane and the adsorbed phase volume, which are neglected in the C-C approximation. By this method, the temperature dependence as well as the uptake dependence of the isosteric heat can be readily investigated, where the former cannot be revealed using the C-C approximation. The influence of the adsorbed phase and the gas behavior (real gas or ideal gas) on the isosteric heat of adsorption are also investigated, which shows that neglecting either the real gas behavior or the adsorbed phase volume always results in an overestimation of the isosteric heat of adsorption. In the Henry's law regime of low pressure and low adsorption uptake (and up to a surface occupancy of <0.5), the isosteric heat of adsorption of methane on Longmaxi shale is approximately constant at 15-47 kJ/mol, but then decreases significantly at higher pressures. This work therefore justifies the method to obtain the true isosteric heat of adsorption for high pressure methane in shale, which lays the foundation for future investigations of the thermodynamics and heat transfer characteristics of the interaction between high pressure methane and shale.

We derive solutions for fluid velocities and the resulting surfactant concentrations, assuming the capillary number and surface Peclet number to he small, as compared with unity. We first focus on a concentric drop configuration and apply Lamb's general solution, assuming the far-field flow to he arbitrary in nature. As representative case studies, we consider two cases: (i) flow dynamics in linear flows and (ii) flow dynamics in a Poiseuille flow, although for the latter case, the concentric configuration does not remain valid in general. We further look into the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of compound drops, subject to linear ambient flow, and compare our predictions with previously reported experiments. Subsequently, the eccentric drop configuration is addressed by using a bipolar coordinate system where the far-field flow is assumed to he axisymmetric but otherwise arbitrary in nature. As a specific example for eccentric drop dynamics, we focus on Poiseuille flow and study the drop migration velocities. Our analysis shows that the presence of surfactant generally opposes the imposed flows, thereby acting like an effective augmented viscosity. Our analysis reveals that maximizing the effects of surfactant makes the drops behave like solid particles suspended in a medium. However, in uniaxial extensional flow, the presence of surfactants on the inner drop, in conjunction with the drop radius ratio, leads to a host of interesting and non-monotonic behaviours for the interface deformation. For eccentric drops, the effect of eccentricity only becomes noticeable after it surpasses a certain critical value, and becomes most prominent when the two interfaces approach each other.

This suggestion is examined with a mathematical model of a harmful algal population, parameterized to represent the toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum, and its limiting nutrient. A small cove with a hydraulic storage zone and longitudinal advection and dispersion is coupled to a larger lake where ongoing or transient blooms serve as a source for the algal population. This population is transported upstream by dispersion and flushed downstream by advection. Morphometry and hydraulics represent a lake in Texas where blooms of P. parvum have been problematic. When dispersion and hydraulic storage are low to moderate, available pumping technology is predicted to be capable of suppressing the algal population within a variable portion of the cove, under both steady state and transient conditions. This suppression occurs when temperature-dependent algal growth is low. At temperatures high enough to support more rapid growth, flow augmentation carries a risk of stimulating a bloom under some hydraulic conditions. The model presented here complements similar models without population sources, and contributes to theoretical understanding of population persistence in reservoirs and other flowing-water habitats.

These points monitored for 18 parameters (water temperature, pH, TN, TP, TOC, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Cr, Cd, Mn, B, Fe, Al, Mg, and Ba). The spatial variability, contamination sources and health risk of trace elements as well as the river Water quality were investigated. Our results were compared with national (CSEPA) and international (WHO, USEPA) drinking water guidelines, revealing that Zn, Cd and Pb were the dominant pollutants in the water body. Application of different multivariate statistical approaches, including correlation matrix and factor/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), to assess the origins of the elements in the Huaihe River, identified three source types that accounted for 79.31% of the total variance. Anthropogenic activities were considered to contribute Much of the Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, and Mn via industrial waste, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust; Ba, B, Cr and Cu were controlled by mixed anthropogenic and natural sources, and Mg, Fe and Al had natural origins from weathered rocks and crustal materials. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to classify the 53 sample points into three groups of water pollution, high pollution, moderate pollution, and low pollution, reflecting influences from tributaries, power plants and vehicle exhaust, and agricultural activities, respectively. The results of the water quality index (WO) indicate that Water in the Huaihe River is heavily polluted by trace elements, so approximately 96% of the water in the Huaihe River is unsuitable for drinking.

The main objective of this study is to simulate common non-potable water demand and roof area typologies and verify how the demand and roof area affect the efficiency of the RWHS. To highlight the usefulness of the model to aid in the definition of tank sizes, we have also performed an economic assessment. Results are specific to the study region's climate and might vary under different climate. However, we have chosen a rather unfavourable climate, with poor rainfall distribution along the year. Under such conditions, results are likely closer to lower bound benefits. This indicates potential water savings benefits of a RWHS even for unfavourable scenarios. The RWHS indicated to be more efficient at meeting demands with smaller Demand-Roof Area ratios. Furthermore, it was possible to determine the efficiency of the RWHS under various scenarios, identifying the minimum and maximum likely benefits. Several scenarios were compared directly allowing for the establishment of a general maximum tank size per unit roof area in a given region of interest, beyond which no significant benefits are likely. The economic assessment indicates positive net present values for investing in RWHS, especially for large rooftop areas and small Demand-Roof Area ratios. Under such conditions, investing in a RWHS has very low risk and will most likely have short payback times. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The owners of these buildings often seek to identify and implement building upgrade measures that are capable of improving building sustainability as well as achieving certification under various green building rating systems such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). In order to support decision-makers in promoting building sustainability and achieving LEED certification for existing building, this paper presents the development of a novel optimization model that is capable of minimizing the required upgrade cost of achieving a desired LEED certification level such as Silver or Gold. The model is designed to identify cost-effective building measures, plans, and/or performance to achieve a specified LEED certification for existing buildings while keeping required upgrade cost to a minimum. The optimization model is implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA) due to its capabilities of identifying optimal solutions for this type of problem in a reasonable computational time, and efficiently and accurately modeling this specific optimization problem with the least number of decision variables and constraints. A project case study of a rest-area building is used to illustrate the optimization model and to demonstrate its novel and unique capabilities.

With further twice seeded swelling polymerization, new hydrophobic PS oil phase sprouted on the strong hydrophilic surface even without any surfactant assistance in aqueous media. The morphologies of these SPS/PS composite particles could be adjusted by changing the crosslinking density of the seed microspheres, the sulfonation temperature and the swelling ratio of monomer/seed.

Many studies indicate diverse and often very high lead levels in the edible parts of game. Considering the number of hunters, the determined levels may pose a public health risk. Shotgun pellets are the main source of lead contamination of game animal tissues. Despite numerous studies indicating lead contamination in game birds, no significant reasons for diverse contamination of tissues with this toxic metal have been reported. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that the explanation for diverse levels of contamination of game animal tissues should be sought in physical phenomena generated by a projectile in damaged animal tissues. A projectile penetrating a target generates a multi-phase medium from destroyed tissues and simultaneously changes the shape of its front part. This movement of a projectile is an example of a turbulent flow. The interpretation of the interaction between a projectile and damaged tissues indicate that the variable and unpredictable parameters of a projectile for each shot and the medium created by a projectile make it impossible to determine the degree of this interaction. The phenomenon of a temporary cavity created by a shot seems to determine the magnitude of lead transfer into tissues surrounding the path of a wound. Fluid mechanics also explains the relatively high lead levels in game birds in comparison with the levels determined in big game animals. In view of the unpredictability of projectile-animal body interactions, it should be assumed that game bird shot with lead pellets contains the lead levels dangerous to human health. Therefore, the use of lead pellets for bird shooting should be banned.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 15121, "input": "Geotextiles have been widely used in the reinforced retaining wall, but it is not easy to measure the deformation of the wall during and after construction.

The availability of these datasets offers a unique opportunity to develop and test a methodology capable of modelling and analyzing the water and carbon dynamics of Mediterranean macchia during the 2001-2010 decade. To this aim, simulation procedures integrating remotely sensed and ancillary data were first tuned towards the available observations of vegetation biomass and soil carbon content. These procedures were then applied to produce daily estimates of macchia actual evapotranspiration (AET), gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), whose accuracy was assessed against corresponding eddy covariance flux tower observations taken in two years (2007-2008). The results obtained are satisfactory and support the capability of the modelling approach to reproduce both the water and carbon dynamics of macchia during the study decade.

Mechanisms responsible for this disparate behaviour are represented in a two-phase, depth-integrated, landslide dynamics model that melds principles from soil mechanics, granular mechanics and fluid mechanics. The model assumes that gradually increasing pore-water pressure causes slope failure to nucleate at the weakest point on a basal slip surface in a statically balanced mass. Failure then spreads to adjacent regions as a result of momentum exchange. Liquefaction is contingent on pore-pressure feedback that depends on the initial soil state. The importance of this feedback is illustrated by using the model to study the dynamics of a disastrous landslide that occurred near Oso, Washington, USA, on 22 March 2014. Alternative simulations of the event reveal the pronounced effects of a landslide mobility bifurcation that occurs if the initial void ratio of water-saturated soil equals the lithostatic, critical-state void ratio.

This unconventional way of feedstock generation can additionally produce value added products apart from clean energy. This review presents current scenario of microalgae applications in biofuel production and micro algae based high value bio-product industries leveraging environmental protection and waste utilization benefits. Microalgae cultivation, harvesting and biomass conversion technologies for biodiesel production have been reviewed based on adapting ancient learning to understand critical factors affecting overall productivity and economic viability. Dedicated efforts from technical experts are still required for economic viability of large scale biodiesel production in spite of positive finding at small scale. Several high value bio-products from microalgae amplified magnetism of trades for investment in this field. Microalgae cultivation intersects two key concern areas of global warming and water pollution control/water recycling by CO2 sequestration and waste water utilization respectively. Integration of suitable upstream and downstream processing technologies with multiple product portfolio would make the microalgae bio-refinery economical viable.", "class": "Civil Engineering"}, {"id": 13653, "input": "Envelopes for biaxial bending capacity of reinforced concrete elements are used extensively in design or in structural safety evaluation to verify the adequacy of internal force resultants from series of axial P and bending moments M(x) and M(y) loading pairs computed for prescribed load combinations. However, existing methods to construct P-M(x)-M(y) (PMM) interaction curves are not appropriate for concrete hydraulic structures because (1) pressurized water could penetrate in cracks leading to a coupled hydromechanical problem and (2) the structural performance is assessed using several criteria related to the allowable cracked area as well as allowable compressive (tensile) stresses for usual, unusual, and extreme load combinations. This paper presents a methodology to construct PMM interaction curves for arbitrary cross sections of hydraulic structures considering multiperformance criteria, water penetration in cracks, as well as the presence of reinforcing steel. The computations are based on a robust and efficient isogonic approach based on strength of materials where the position of the neutral axis is systematically varied over the cross section to find PMM equilibrium solutions. Four application examples of the proposed approach are presented (1) to illustrate its versatility, (2) to validate the results, and (3) to show its convergence properties. In some cases, PMM capacity envelopes are formed by distinct closed surfaces where equilibrium solutions are possible. This type of PMM capacity envelope, which the proposed algorithm is able to construct, is not found for classical reinforced concrete elements.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 16907, "input": "In manufacturing engineering, especially in machining process, the definition of a reference plane is the first essential step within the overall process. After the reference plane is applied at the component all other features are processed with reference to this basic plane. During any process the component has to be clamped in order to resist the processing forces. There are several clamping systems available, such as pneumatic, magnetic systems or magneto-rheological (MR) systems. Depending on its stiffness the component is deformed due to the clamping forces, stresses are introduced. This effect can be neglected for components with a high stiffness and nearly rigid body behaviour. However, the deformation of low stiff components under clamping forces, e.g. sheet metals, is relatively large and is in the same range as the addressed accuracy of machining process. Due to the introduced elastic clamping stresses the component will reconfigure after clamping, this phenomenon is known as springback. The focus of this work is the design of a clamping system for flexible bodies in order to reduce the springback and to enable high precision processing. This clamping system consists in a set of supports, which adjust to the surface of the body without introducing stresses and causing no springback after the machining process. The number and the arrangement of the supports are optimized as a function of the intensity and position of the milling force and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the body as well. The functional unit of the clamping system is a cylindrical bodysliding nearly frictionless within a pipe. Numerical simulation is used for configuration and optimization. The developed clamping systems can also be used to process freeform shaped bodies.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 4383, "input": "At least since 1980, there has been a practically continuous, but somewhat fragmented discussion on the relevance of management research.

In this paper, it is argued that prior analyses have not reached the root causes of the irrelevance problem. By an analysis of the recent history of management research, the following novel findings are reached. First, the root cause of the irrelevance is argued to lie in the 1959 reports on American business education, written by Pierson and Gordon & Howell. Second, while the proposed direction in the 1959 reports was deficient in several ways, the rejection of production as an integral part of organizations and management has been perhaps the most damaging feature of those reports.

However, whereas fast and accurate reconstruction of building interiors is essential to any collaborative construction management process, manual creation and utilization of a 3D as-built model typically results in low productivity and erroneous modeling results. This paper proposes a semi-automated method that accounts for and resolves the major problems in the streamlined manual process of 3D as-built model creation in BIM. The method generates a 3D wireframe model combined with clutter data, which is then imported into a BIM tool for as-built modeling. The present study evaluates the proposed method by applying it to two typical rooms in a test building. The 3D as-built model was then subjected to an accuracy assessment using reference points acquired by a total station. The contributions of the proposed method, as compared with fully manual operation, are: (1) reduction of the huge data size of the original point clouds; (2) improvement of the productivity of as-built BIM creation with the aid of 3D wireframes; and (3) accuracy enhancement through a refinement process that entails segmentation and regularization. However, the proposed method is limited to building interiors consisting of planar structures; the modeling of detailed objects, such as windows and doors, unfortunately, still requires manual operation. Thus, further research on detail modeling and refinement is necessary in order to increase the method's automation and enhancement of its overall suitability for mapping complex indoor environments.

The research was completed in three restored reaches and one reference reach at the Virginia Tech Stream Research, Education, and Management Laboratory. The laboratory is unique because three different restoration treatments were applied contiguously along a stream, and the restoration practices ranged from passive to active. The passive reach included cattle exclusion, while the active reaches included cattle exclusion as well as vegetation plantings, bank sloping and the construction of inset floodplains. Three-dimensional velocities were measured near the channel bed in run and glide biotopes within the three restored reaches, as well as an upstream reference reach. The velocities were utilized to analyse and compare near-bed turbulent structure across the reaches. While the restoration activities did not address the channel bed directly, differences in physical structure of the two physical biotopes were observed among restoration treatments, likely because of changes in bank shape and roughness due to vegetation differences. Differences between reference and restored reaches were still evident approximately 3years after cattle exclusion and construction activities. Few differences were observed in the hydraulic structure between runs and glides, and the near-bed flow structure in both runs and glides was related to local roughness.

Several methods are available to estimate the artificial recharge; however, most of them require field data or model parameters, thus limiting their applications. To overcome this limitation, we presented an analytical method to estimate the artificial recharge through monitoring the water release by piezometer and analysing the controlling factors of the artificial recharge from a hill dam in Tunisia. A total of 97 measurements of water flow in the streambed recorded from 4 gauging stations were analysed. Results indicated that the average infiltration velocity ranged from 0.043 to 0.127 m/d and the infiltration index varied from 7.6 to 11.8 L/(s.km). Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis shows that the infiltration index, the stream gradient, the thickness of unsaturated zone, the number of infiltration pond, the stream geometry, and the water flow rate were found to be the main factors in determining the infiltration. The high correlation coefficients (0.908 for the number of infiltration pond and 0.999 for the stream geometry) mean that the number of infiltration pond and the stream geometry are the most influential factors. Time variations of groundwater level were used to analyze the recharge effects on the piezometry of aquifer. The analysis showed that during the artificial recharge, the water table increased at a rate of 5 mm/d and that the increase was limited to the area surrounding the recharge site.

However, the poor energy-saving performance is its major fault. On the contrary, the pump-controlled hydraulic system has the significant advantage of energy-saving which meets the current demand in modern machine design. In this paper, the simulation analysis using Matlab/Simulink and DSHplus for a newly developed energy-saving hydraulic tube bender is conducted. Instead of the conventional fixed displacement hydraulic pump, the new hydraulic tube bender utilizes an internal gear pump with AC servomotor as its driving power source. In the new energy-saving hydraulic circuit, the use of conventional pressure relief valve is no longer necessary since the demanded flow-rate and pressure output can be precisely obtained by continuously changing the speed of the AC servomotor. In addition, from the simulation results, it is shown that the energy-saving performance of load-sensing control scheme is somewhat better than that of constant pressure control scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the newly developed hydraulic tube bender can save up to 40 % of energy consumption in a working cycle as compared to the conventional hydraulic tube bender.

Seepage generated from subsurface flow causes hillslope instability by reducing the soil shear strength and mobilizing soil particles and can produce cavelike features called seepage undercuts that can lead to contour failure. As the main threat to contour plowing, seepage results in large amounts of soil erosion due to row grade. Models used to predict seepage over a time series will provide a basis for modeling soil erosion resulting from seepage in contour ridging systems. Understanding seepage and its effects will advance our knowledge regarding seepage erosion mechanisms in contour ridge systems. In this study, 23 treatments were arranged using an orthogonal rotatable central composite design to model a seepage time series, build a simple seepage prediction model and investigate the effects of row grade, field slope and ridge height on seepage discharge. Most of the seepage discharge time series followed an S-shaped curve. The seepage discharge processes were fit by an exponential model with a determination coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.995. Furthermore, the physical meaning of the exponential model was consistent with the experimental results. The seepage discharge continuously increased before the inflection point and then decreased. Finally, the seepage discharge approached a steady value. The maximum seepage discharge growth rate was achieved within 14 min, and the seepage discharge became steady within 106 min. Second-order polynomial regression models were used to determine the total and predicted steady seepage discharge using independent variables of row grade, field slope and ridge height, which produced R-2 values of 0.66 (p < 0.05) and 0.68 (p < 0.05), respectively. Ridge height and row grade significantly affected (p < 0.05) the total and predicted steady seepage discharge. Field slope (and its related factors) was ignored because it had no significant effects on seepage discharge.

Specifically the fluid flow field transporting surfactant from foam Plateau borders (fed with surfactant-rich material) towards comparatively surfactant-lean foam films is considered. The extent to which this surfactant mass transfer is limited by surface viscous effects is studied. Previous work (Vitasari et al.. 2016) made assumptions about the likely flow field along the Plateau border surface. These assumptions suggested that 'high' surface viscosity (measured by a suitable dimensionless parameter) led to strong suppression of the rate of surfactant mass transfer from Plateau border to film, whereas 'low' surface viscosity did not suppress this mass transfer rate in any significant way. More detailed fluid mechanical calculations which are carried out here corroborate the aforementioned assumptions in the 'high' surface viscosity regime. However the calculations suggest that in the low' surface viscosity regime, in contrast to the findings from the previous assumptions, moderate reductions in the rate of surfactant mass transfer are also possible. Counterintuitively these moderate reductions in mass transfer rate potentially have more negative impact on fractionation processes than the aforementioned strong suppression. This is because they tend to arise under conditions for which the efficiency of the fractionation system is particularly sensitive to any reduction whatsoever in the surfactant mass transfer rate.

A large number of elongated rod-like phase were precipitated in solution-treated sample after impacting; the rod-like phases in peak-aged sample experienced shortening and thinning, and some of which finally transformed into spherical-like phases, namely the rod-like phases were preliminarily dissolved into the matrix. Based on thermodynamics and kinetics analyses, the high strain rate, high density dislocation, high shear stress and adiabatic temperature rise induced by explosive impact process make it possible for precipitates to precipitate and dissolve preliminarily within about 3.1 mu s.

There is little information on commercial planting operations for willow biomass crops in North America. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the field capacities of two commercial machines (Step and Egedal Energy Planter) planting willow crops in northern New York State, determine the amount and distribution of delays. A study was conducted to evaluate planter activities. The two machines had similar mean field capacities (C-f) ranging from 0.89 to 1.14 ha h(-1). Above-average rainfall in the later part of the planting season decreased Cf by over 20% for the Step planter from 1.14 to 0.91 ha h(-1); largely due to delays in the headlands. Approximately 70% of the total delay time associated with the Step planter consisted of long-duration delays (>5 min) compared to 35% for the Egedal. Quality of planting stock was an issue for operations; undersized stems resulted in feeding issues. Several potential factors were identified for improved planting operations: loading stems and clearing feeding mechanisms at each turn, improved planting stock and quality control, improving machine design for wet conditions, and improved preparation for in-field repairs. In-field delays should be minimized to reduce demand on the crew and ensure a more uniform crop is established in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The common problem represents the precise reproduction of geometrical form. The reasons for form deviation can be e. g. varying properties of the semi-finished product as well as wear of the punch-bending machine or the punch-bending tool themself. Usually the process parameters are manually adjusted on the introduction of new production scenario or after the deviation between the actual form of produced pieces and the designed form become clear. The choice of new process parameters is normally based on the experience of the machine operators. It leads to a time-consuming and expensive procedure right on the early stages of production scenarios as well as during the established production process. Furthermore, the trend of miniaturization of part sizes along with narrowing tolerances and increase in the strengths of materials drastically pushes up the requirements on the production process. Aiming at reduction of scrap rate and setup-time of production scenarios, a model-based approach is chosen to design a self-correcting control strategy. The strategy is designed by modeling the bending process. In the first step the bending process has to be analyzed on the model by varying of process variables influencing the process significantly. It is done by corresponding simulations. After that, the correlations between significant variables and geometrical deviation were defined and different self-correcting control strategies were designed and tested. In order to identify and validate the simulation and to test the quality of the self-correcting control strategies, a special experimental tool was built up. The experimental tool is equipped with an additional measurement device and can be operated on a universal testing machine. Finally, the self-correcting control strategies were tested under real production conditions on the original tool in order to address further influences of the punch-bending machine on the manufacturing process.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 36082, "input": "The local material behaviour of cast metal and injection moulded parts is highly related to the geometrical design of the part as well as to a large number of process parameters.

Accurate estimation of scour around pipelines is therefore a key topic of research for marine engineers. This paper presents results from a numerical study of clear-water scour depth below a submarine pipeline for a range of steady flow conditions. The flow field around a pipeline under scour equilibrium conditions was numerically simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the standard k-epsilon turbulence closure. The flow discharge through the scour hole for various flow conditions was then investigated, and the results were used to establish the relationship between the flow discharge and the maximum scour depth. By incorporating the Colebrook-White equation, the bed shear stress was obtained and an iterative method was developed to predict the scour depth around the pipeline. The calculated scour depths using the proposed method agreed well with laboratory measurements, with the average absolute relative error being smaller than that obtained by using previous methods. Therefore, this proposed method can be used to predict the clear-water scour around submarine pipelines with improved accuracy.", "class": "Mechanical Engineering"}, {"id": 11513, "input": "Conventional high torque low speed drive systems commonly have a mechanical transmission between the induction motor and the load consisting of gears, gear heads, belt/pulleys or camshafts.

Through a split type thermodynamic cycle design, quasi-isothermal compression of the charge air and isobaric combustion of the air/fuel mixture can be performed separately in two chambers. Within such a design, the exhaust heat can be recovered to the intake air flow between the compression chamber and combustion chamber. Consequently, the recovered energy can be re-utilized in the combustor directly, and an intra-cycle waste heat recovery process can be achieved. To investigate the fundamental aspects of this new methodology, a comparative study between the conventional Rankine based WHR and the new ICWHR was undertaken. Both theoretical and numerical analysis were applied to evaluate the performance characteristics of these two technologies. The ICWHR cycle differs from the Rankine cycle in that an energy conversion subsystem is not necessary since the recovered energy is sent back to the combustion chamber directly, and then the system efficiency is improved significantly. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the full cycle efficiency of ICWHR system is determined by the regeneration effectiveness, the compression ratio and the fuel equivalence ratio, then the limitations of Rankine cycle, such as working fluid selection and system parameter calibration can be avoided mechanically. Finally, through a one dimensional system model, analysis of optimal operation range, system efficiency and the heat transfer behaviours of ICWHR system are discussed in this paper and comparisons made with a Rankine cycle WHR system.

Therefore, model based method should be a viable way to generate adequate data to train the networks for the intelligent big-end bearing fault diagnosis in IC engines.

Therefore, we only need build a proper simulation model to simulate the correct envelope signals rather than the raw vibration signals.

Next, we built an ANN-based bearing knock diagnosis system which consists of three phases: fault detection phase, fault localization phase and fault severity identification phase. Particularly, a saturating linear function is selected as the transfer function of the fault severity identification stage, so the networks can linearly classify the fault levels and the output is more in agreement with the reality in industry.

In this article, pre-operative and post-operative assessments of sinus cavity as well as novel approaches to deepen our knowledge of the behavior of bone substitute materials are described. The awareness of the patient's morphologic conditions enables exact planning of invasive surgery and aids to avoid complications. Pre-operative radiologic evaluation of the region before sinus lift is advisable both for a planning of the sinus augmentation and for selection and alignment of the optimum placement of implants. On the orthopantomography it is possible to measure the vertical dimension of graft, but not the volume and 3D changes. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become the \"gold standard\" to plan a comprehensive implant treatment and to achieve a post-operative assessment.

Among the alternatives of upgrading biogas to biomethane, this work focuses on membrane permeation. Taking cellulose acetate as membrane material and spiral-wound as membrane configuration, five layouts are assessed. All layouts have the same biogas plant rated at 500 m(3)/h (STP), yet they may adopt: (i) one- or two-stage permeation, (ii) permeate or residue recycle, and (iii) a water heater or a prime mover (internal combustion engine or a micro gas turbine) to exploit residues as fuel gas. Since residues are consumed, all layouts have zero emission of methane into the atmosphere. The membrane material is modeled considering the phenomenon of plasticization; the membrane modules are described by a crossflow permeation patterns without pressure drops. The results indicates that specific membrane areas range from 1.1 to 2.4 m(2)h/m(3) (STP), specific energy from 0.33 to 0.47 kWh/m(3) (STP), and exergy efficiencies from 57.6% to 88.9%. The splitting of permeation over two stages and the adoption of water heater instead of prime movers is a convenient option. The preferred layout employs a single compressor, a two-stage membrane permeation at 26 bar, a water heater fueled by the first-stage permeate, and a second-stage permeate recycle.

Field-based studies have led to qualitative conceptual models and to numerical stimulations of river processes involving wood. Numerous important gaps remain, however, in our understanding of wood dynamics. The majority of research on wood in rivers focuses on small-to medium-sized rivers, defined using the ratio of wood piece size to channel width as channels narrower than the locally typical wood-piece length (small) and slightly narrower than the longer wood pieces present (medium). Although diverse geographic regions and biomes are represented by one or a few studies in each region, the majority of research comes from perennial rivers draining temperate conifer forests. Regional syntheses most commonly focus on the Pacific Northwest region of North America where most of these studies originate. Consequently, significant gaps in our understanding include lack of knowledge of wood-related processes in large rivers, dryland rivers, and rivers of the high and low latitudes. Using a wood budget as an organizing framework, this paper identifies other gaps related to wood recruitment, transport, storage, and how beavers influence LW dynamics. With respect to wood recruitment, we lack information on the relative importance of mass tree mortality and transport of buried or surficial downed wood from the floodplain into the channel in diverse settings. Knowledge gaps related to wood transport include transport distances of LW and thresholds for LW mobility in small to medium rivers. With respect to wood storage, we have limited data on longitudinal trends in LW loads within unaltered large and great rivers and on fluctuations in LW load over time intervals greater than a few years. Other knowledge gaps relate to physical and ecological effects of wood, including the magnitude of flow resistance caused by LW; patterns of wood-related sediment storage for diverse river sizes and channel geometry; quantification of channel-floodplain-LW interactions; and potential threshold effects of LW in relation to physical processes and biotic communities. Finally, knowledge gaps are related to management of large wood and river corridors, including understanding the consequences of enormous historical reductions in LW load in rivers through the forested portions of the temperate zone; and how to effectively reintroduce and manage existing LW in river corridors, which includes enhancing public understanding of the importance of LW. Addressing these knowledge gaps requires more case studies from diverse rivers, as well as more syntheses and metadata analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study can help to optimize GB misorientation configurations by identifying the cases that would improve the material properties increasing resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. In order to understand and optimize, it is important to understand the influence of misorientation angle on the atomic clustered hydrogen distribution under the impact of dilatational stress distributions. In this study, a number of bi-crystal models with tilt grain boundary (TGB) misorientation angles (theta) ranging between 0 degrees < theta < 90 degrees were developed, with rotation performed about the [001] axis, using numerical microstructural finite element analysis. Subsequently, local stress and strain concentrations generated along the TGB (due to the difference in individual neighbouring crystals elastic anisotropy response as functions of misorientation angles) were evaluated when bi-crystals were subjected to overall uniform applied traction. Finally, the hydrogen distribution and segregations as a function of misorientation angles were studied. In real nickel, as opposed to the numerical model, geometrically necessary dislocations are generated due to GB misorientation. The generated dislocation motion along TGBs in response to dilatational mismatch varies depending on the misorientation angles. These generated dislocation motions affect the stress, strain and hydrogen distribution. Hydrogen segregates along these dislocations acting as traps and since the dislocation distribution varies depending on misorientation angles the hydrogen traps are also influenced by misorientation angles. From the results of numerical modelling it has been observed that the local stress, strain and hydrogen distributions are inhomogeneous, affected by the misorientation angles, orientations of neighbouring crystal and boundary conditions. In real material, as opposed to the numerical model, the clustered atomic hydrogens are segregated in traps near to the TGB due to the influence of dislocations developed under the effects of applied mechanical stress. The numerical model predicts maximum hydrogen concentrations are accumulated on the TGB with misorientation angles ranging between 15 degrees< theta < 45 degrees. This investigation reinforces the importance of GB engineering for designing and optimizing these materials to decrease hydrogen segregation arising from TGB misorientation angles.

The present review first examines the various facets of aquaporin function in stomatal guard cells and shows that it involves transport of water but also of other molecules such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. At the whole plant level, changes in tissue hydraulics mediated by root and shoot aquaporins can indirectly impact plant transpiration. Recent studies also point to a feedback effect of transpiration on aquaporin function. These mechanisms may contribute to the difference between isohydric and anisohydric stomatal regulation of leaf water status. The contribution of aquaporins to transpiration control goes far beyond the issue of water transport during stomatal movements and involves emerging cellular and long-distance signalling mechanisms which ultimately act on plant growth. This review examines the relation between aquaporins and transpiration, two key components influencing plant water status. Aquaporins transport water and other molecules such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide during stomatal movements. The function of aquaporins in roots and shoots is also intimately linked to transpiration.

Four models with descendent LPA angulation equalled to 120 degrees, 110 degrees, 100 degrees and 90 degrees, were reconstructed by computer-aided design for the virtual simulation of the pulmonary flow under different surgical strategies. Computational fluid dynamics was introduced to calculate the pulmonary blood flow in five models. Streamlines, wall shear stress, energy loss and flow distribution ratio were calculated and compared to determine the better haemodynamics in the pulmonary artery. RESULTS: Vortices were formed at the lower wall of the opening of right PA and LPA in models with LPA angles equal to or less than 100 degrees (Models 3 and 4). Relative high wall shear stress areas at the lateral and lower wall of LPA opening had an ascendant tendency as the angle declined.

Finally, the simulation and the deduction of the proposed approach are given in case study so as to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy optimal selection approach.", "class": "Computer Science"}, {"id": 23822, "input": "Nowadays online resources play an important role in teaching and learning thanks to new advances in technology. This importance is enhanced in scientific areas and even more for distance education universities, where the classic hands-on laboratories are not always possible. For that reason, this face-toface laboratory practices have been replaced or even complemented with online virtual and remote laboratories VRL. Normally, these applications arc developed with high level programming tools, and these, to greater or lesser extent, use Java. Unfortunately, the newly discovered Java security issues and the impossibility to run Java in smart devices are an restriction to the dissemination of this kind of applications. This work is the first step towards get a new structure to Easy Java/Javascript Simulations (EjsS) that allows a remote connection with hardware devices. In this regard, the first objective is to solve the problems with Java applications when using EjsS. The proposed solution provides the user a structure to reuse their VRLs using a Java model that runs in a server and is linked with a Javascript graphical user interface in the client device.", "class": "Electrical Engineering"}, {"id": 26312, "input": "One important motivation for people behaving prosocially is that they want to avoid negative and obtain positive emotions. In the prosocial behavior literature however, the motivations to avoid negative emotions (e.g., guilt) and to approach positive emotions (e.g., warm glow) are rarely separated, and sometimes even aggregated into a single mood-management construct. The aim of this study was to investigate whether anticipated guilt if not helping and anticipated warm glow if helping are influenced similarly or differently when varying situational factors related to personal responsibility to help. Helping scenarios were created and pilot tests established that each helping scenario could be formulated both in a high-responsibility version and in a low-responsibility version. In Study 1 participants read high-responsibility and low-responsibility helping scenarios, and rated either their anticipated guilt if not helping or their anticipated warm glow if helping (i.e., separate evaluation). Study 2 was similar but here participants rated both their anticipated guilt if not helping and their anticipated warm glow if helping (i.e., joint evaluation). Anticipated guilt was clearly higher in the high-responsibility versions, but anticipated warm glow was unaffected (in Studies 1a and 1b), or even higher in the low-responsibility versions (Study 2). In Studies 3 (where anticipated guilt and warm glow were evaluated separately) and 4 (where they were evaluated jointly), personal responsibility to help was manipulated within-subjects. Anticipated guilt was again constantly higher in the high-responsibility versions but for many types of responsibility-manipulations, anticipated warm glow was higher in the low-responsibility versions. The results suggest that we anticipate guilt if not fulfilling our responsibility but that we anticipate warm glow primarily when doing over and beyond our responsibility. We argue that future studies investigating motivations for helping should measure both anticipated negative consequences for oneself if not helping, and anticipated positive consequences for oneself if helping.", "class": "Psychology"}, {"id": 16814, "input": "In fluid mechanics, there is an essential deficiency of the analytical solutions of Navier-Stokes equations for 3D case of non-stationary flow. We explore the ansatz of derivation of non-stationary solution for the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of incompressible flow, which was suggested earlier. In general case, such a solution should be obtained from the mixed system of 2 Riccati ordinary differential equations (in regard to the time-parameter t). But we find an elegant way to simplify it to the proper analytical presentation via exact solutions. The results are substantiated with illustrative examples, including numerical computations and appropriate figures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The new absorbers composed of one lossy left-handed material absorbing layer and one impedance matching layer consisted of lossless right-handed material. It is indicated that the reflection loss of below -20dB can be obtained in the frequency range 7GHz-13GHz. Power attenuation achieving -50dB of narrow frequency band electromagnetic absorbers can also be obtained by modulate permittivity of right-handed material. Furthermore, the thickness of the whole absorbing structure is only 2mm, which is particularly helpful in some practical applications. The presented results are of reference significance for accurate design of the new electromagnetic absorbers and of practical prospects for stealth technology.", "class": "Civil Engineering"}, {"id": 7204, "input": "Background: Martial arts such as judo, taekwondo and wrestling are regulated, usually athletic duels. The aim is to score better than your opponent or to win. As with any type of sport, athletes in martial arts sustain minor and major injuries, which may have many negative consequences. In addition, sports injuries and their rehabilitation generate high costs to the healthcare system. In contrast to the FIFA 11+ warm-up program, no preventive programs have been postulated for injury prevention in these martial arts. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarise the latest research findings and to evaluate whether initial recommendations can be given for the reduction of injuries in the martial arts judo, wrestling and taekwondo. Methods: To gain an overview of the latest research findings, we searched for systematic reviews in PEDro, PubMed, Cochrane and the internet search engine Google Scholar. The methodological quality of these reviews was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Tool for a Systematic Review (CASP), and data was extracted on the risk of injury, injury location and injury type. Results: It was found that all three review articles are of low to moderate methodological quality. Regarding injury location, it became evident that the extremities are particularly vulnerable to injury in all three martial arts. Effusion was observed to be the most common type of injury. Conclusion: Due to the moderate methodological quality and the injury type of effusion, it is not possible to formulate recommendations for injury prevention. Moreover, uniform definitions should be developed to describe sports injuries.", "class": "Medical Science"}, {"id": 46169, "input": "We use the combination of liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF-MS) and urine metabolic profiling to find and identify the metabolites of dextromethorphan, a common over-the-counter (OTC) cough suppressant. Next, we use the combination of ion masses, their MS/MS fragmentation, and retention times to determine dextromethorphan and its metabolites in surface water impacted by wastewater. Prior to this study, neither dextromethorphan nor its metabolites have been reported in surface water; in spite of its common use in over 100 various OTC medications. We found that the concentration of the dextrorphan metabolite in surface water greatly exceeded the parent compound by factors of 5-10 times, which reflects the urine profile, where parent compound is approximately <2% of the total excreted drug based on ion intensities. Urine profiling also indicated that glucuronide metabolites are major phase 2 products (92% of the total) in urine and then are completely hydrolyzed in wastewater to dextrorphan and N-demethyldextrorphan, which are phase 1 metabolites-a \"kind of reversal\" of human metabolism.
